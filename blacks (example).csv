1,John Kernen,Local Guide·34 reviews·178 photos,,2 months ago,Fatty beef brisket sandwich is soooooo good!
2,Kevin Wimble,Local Guide·27 reviews·264 photos,,2 years ago,"Hands Down Best Barbecue I have ever had!  Brisket has a great crust, gorgeous smoke ring and amazingly tender.  If you are in Austin you must stop here."
3,D'Angelo Portis,Local Guide·24 reviews·6 photos,,2 years ago,"Let it be known that I speak from the perspective of a non-texas citizen. It was my first time in this state and I knew I absolutely had to try some barbeque before I left. I'd heard the rumors and stories about its quality and flavor, and i had to opportunity to try it firsthand. Let me say that i was far from disappointed. The food was absolutely amazing, and the atmosphere was excellent. I sat outside with my friends and enjoyed a nice half pound of brisket and ribs. No abuse was necessary, as the meat was tender and flavorful all on it's own. I fell in love on the first bite. Outside of the excellent meat was the wonderful macaroni. I cant even describe it, but it was rich and delicious. I even went so far as to compliment the people near the register, which I almost never do.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is around, and would even go out of my way to eat here. Easiest 5 star I've ever given."
4,Eric Miller,Local Guide·114 reviews·26 photos,,a year ago,Their brisket is just amazing!
5,randall wills,Local Guide·108 reviews·150 photos,,2 months ago,Some say Blacks started BBQ … the original is worth a drive out of town but now you are blessed to have that taste of history right here in town … go hungry!
6,Gary Moore,Local Guide·215 reviews·14 photos,,a month ago,Good..but always crowded
7,Rafael Pastore,Local Guide·16 reviews·102 photos,,3 years ago,Amazing smoked bbq. Best beef ribs.
8,Google Guide,"Local Guide·288 reviews·3,200 photos",,3 years ago,"If there's a line going out the door, it's got to be good!  This place did not disappoint. the barbecue sandwich was so large that we made it to two meals between us both. I wish you could bottle up the smell of a smoke because I would buy it. LOL"
9,For A Few Bites More,Local Guide·25 reviews·40 photos,,3 years ago,"Maybe we came on an off day, it happens, but we felt the brisket was dry. The beef rib was the star of the show. Worth a trip, and we'll be back,  but we need to see more before changing this rating"
10,Texanna James,Local Guide·202 reviews·989 photos,,3 years ago,"If I'm leaving an honest review I have to say I did not enjoy it. I ate it, but I have  had better bbq in many places around this state,  including in Austin and no, I'm not referring to Franklin's. As a matter of fact,  I'm eating better brisket as I write this review.  That's not to say Blacks was not fun, and I would go back if paying with opm. The bbq was edible but this is Texas, I'm a native and my standards are higher.  While I did enjoy watching my buddy spoon HOT mac n cheese on his fingers then wipe them on his pants bc he couldn't find a napkin,  self serve in a restaurant this expensive 👎🏿👎🏿. Food judgements: Brisket should never be dry, ribs should never be tough and I, personally, would prefer a different sausage casing. The sides were standard bbq faire: hot & creamy mac and cheese 😁; the green bean recipe needs reworking (bacon) as does the corn, both looked boring and continued on that path in regards to flavor.  I had no desire to put the cream corn (I 💞💞💞 cream corn) in my mouth. I did enjoy the crust on the peach cobbler, I did enjoy the fatty edge on the brisket. I enjoyed the patio. But, just like the original in Lockhart, I'm in no hurry to go back and I'm not waiting in line for it. Juicy, tender meat morsels these were not. But for tourists, this place is cool and u should definitely go here, just don't judge all Texas bbq by this joint. It is however, a proud Texas family owned business and deserves your support!"
11,Miguel Vargas,15 reviews,,3 months ago,"I have to go couple more times.
And trying different dishes or different meets..."
12,Jimmy Rockwell,Local Guide·116 reviews·32 photos,,4 months ago,Always great BBQ! Excellent service too!
13,Keith Alrick,Local Guide·75 reviews·49 photos,,3 years ago,"Cafeteria style ordering process where you order everything by the pound. We got brisket, sausage and the Giant Beef Rib with a couple different sides. The brisket was very good but the beef rib stole the show. It was probably the highlight of the trip as well.

We weren't used to ordering things by the pound so we definitely got way too much so keep that in mind when ordering."
14,Steve Cruz,Local Guide·10 reviews,,6 months ago,"Hands down, best BBQ in central Texas! - period. Street Corn is amazing too"
15,Wade Smith,6 reviews,,11 months ago,"Just had an order delivered by Door Dash. No napkins, no utensils and when I went to open my sack, the juice from the beans had saturated the bottom of the sack and most of my food fell on the hotel floor. I was able to eat what didn’t fall out of the wrapper. Do not order delivery from this place, it’s a lot of money to eat a mess with your hands."
16,Bálint László,Local Guide·191 reviews·226 photos,,2 years ago,"Wow, amazing place! Beef ribs, beef brisket, sausages with jalapeños. They were all awesome. Rapid and kind service."
17,Joanne Kung,Local Guide·13 reviews·19 photos,,4 years ago,We went to give it a try but was very disappointed. The brisket was very dry. The rib is DRY as well. Not that flavorful. Just overall very disappointed. Wont come back again. Rudy’s and county line are much better!
18,Sam Zolin,Local Guide·107 reviews·30 photos,,3 years ago,"I really enjoyed eating at Black’s. Both the beef rib and the brisket were great. Service was fast, even at lunch time. I would definitely come back."
19,Elizabeth Gutierrez,Local Guide·27 reviews·26 photos,,a year ago,I'm from Houston and came to Austin to work and came here to Black's Barbecue... ONE OF THE BEST BRISKET SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD!! definitely will be back!!!!!
20,Sarah LeVesque,Local Guide·39 reviews·1 photo,,3 months ago,Great service and amazing food🤪🤤
21,David Mauk,Local Guide·129 reviews·13 photos,,4 months ago,Quick service and ok bbq !
22,Portia Chandler,Local Guide·28 reviews·113 photos,,a year ago,Great experience. Biggest ribs I've ever seen!
23,Isabel Stgo,Local Guide·48 reviews·9 photos,,3 years ago,"* First time visitor *

My experience was amazing, the food, services and beers are incredible!

Thank you and see y’all soon!"
24,Connor Finch,Local Guide·29 reviews·9 photos,,2 years ago,"California BBQ is a joke compared to this place! Get the fatty brisket, you won't regret it 🥩"
25,Dongmin Shin (Tony),Local Guide·54 reviews·74 photos,,2 years ago,"Great quality of meat.
Cozy but vibrant atmosphere to feel Texas.
Highly recommended!"
26,David Riedel,9 reviews,,5 months ago,"spectacularly mediocre
For Blacks bbq I expected better. We went on a Saturday night. There was a line out the door, expected a wait, 30 minutes later we are still in line. The veggie lady was friendly but that was it. 1 guy SLOWLY cutting meat (the cause of the long wait).  We got brisket and chicken. The brisket had no flavor and the chicken was dry, the bbq sauce is needed unlike better bbq. The Mexican corn was good and had good flavor.
Go for blacks in Lockhart or Franklins for real Texas bbq"
27,adan salazar,Local Guide·25 reviews,,8 months ago,I will gladly pay 20$ for their beef ribs. The brisket sandwich is great too. The desserts as well.
28,Danny Saenz,3 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"Great barbecue! I had the brisket, pork ribs, sausage and even tried the giant beef rib. I must say it was very good post oak smoked barbecue."
29,Nathan Harold,Local Guide·69 reviews·9 photos,,2 years ago,"From the moment you walk in, Black's smells the part of a proper BBQ joint. For my money, go straight for the brisket. Both the lean and the fatty are fantastic. Just the right amount of smoke, falling apart tender and not dry. The fatty brisket is the most exceptional of the bunch (not normally my favorite but this just knocks it out of the park). The mac and cheese was also very good: simple, creamy, and cheesy. The BBQ competition in Austin is fierce, but this holds up very well."
30,Louis Ware,20 reviews,,8 months ago,"I just tried Black BBQ, I got a half pound of brisket. The brisket was tenderish, it had no detectable seasons in the meat. There was no identifiable taste of wood smoke, and it seemed to have a hard bark on it as the server cut it. This the worst stuff labeled as Texas BBQ, this meat will be smothered in BBQ sauce. I was taught that a good piece of meat only needs a knife and fork. Black's failed as real Texas BBQ😒"
31,amerikanerfreund,2 reviews,,7 months ago,"The meat is good. The service -not  so much. First of all it's very hard to hear anything thru their masks. Speak up and speak clearly ! The servers look vacuous and act mum. From them it's not ""thanks come again "" after You  buy 4 pounds of meat . ""Its pull your mask up"". Not going back any time soon to the Guadalupe  st. Austin . And I blew 50 buck in there."
32,Luis Marcano,Local Guide·182 reviews·202 photos,,2 years ago,"Great barbecue, the sausages were amazing as well as the brisket!!!"
33,Stephen Liu,Local Guide·42 reviews·126 photos,,3 years ago,"Just landed and headed to here based off of recommendation from someone at rental car company. Very juicy and tender brisket.

Half a pound was plenty as free white bread comes with!

The corn and Mac and cheese were spot on

Great BBQ and side dishes for a good price"
34,Sarah Gorospe,Local Guide·120 reviews·600 photos,,2 years ago,It was a good experience...staff was pleasant and welcoming...but it makes me more curious about the long lines at the other BBQ joint around 8 mins away...
35,Catherine Jennings,44 reviews,,7 months ago,"Food was good. Not great. Got busy after we got our food, and had to wait in a long line to get another drink."
36,Michelle Romero,119 reviews·90 photos,,11 months ago,Fatty brisket did not disappoint!
37,Dustin F,Local Guide·29 reviews·12 photos,,2 months ago,"Very friendly, great food, worth the price"
38,Patrick McDonough,Local Guide·61 reviews·1 photo,,8 months ago,Too expensive. Food was tasty and had plenty. Long wait in line.
39,doug glenn,74 reviews·55 photos,,a year ago,Outstanding brisket and jalapeno cheddar link...with a peach cobbler chaser!  In business since 1932 for a reason...they're the best!
40,John Tucker,Local Guide·43 reviews,,a year ago,"Black's checks all the boxes. Good brisket. Good pork ribs. Good Texas BBQ sauce. None of it was out of this world, best I ever had; but it was all quality Texas-style BBQ like I grew up eating. Good,  friendly service. AC works! (Which is important when eating too much good BBQ on these Texas summer afternoons)"
41,nick hardrict,Local Guide·119 reviews·109 photos,,a year ago,Wow!! Every meat that We got to try was...Smoked to perfection and every side option was delicious!! Can't wait to go back. It was worth every dime.
42,George T (Georgio),Local Guide·42 reviews·6 photos,,5 months ago,The best bbq I’ve ever had!
43,Darren Baker,Local Guide·164 reviews·195 photos,,8 months ago,I would like to give 3.5 stars and the place was not bad however I have had better so this place was a little overhyped. The lean brisket was a bit grisly and dry. The outside of it was like eating beef jerky which is not too desirable.
44,Markus “Mr LG” Long,Local Guide·71 reviews·94 photos,,8 months ago,Everything was simple and great
45,Ryan Bucher,Local Guide·52 reviews·22 photos,,a year ago,"KC guy here, I was skeptical, being from KC but the emphasis on good brisket down here is impressive, some of the best I've had. No sauce needed, which is actually BBQ. I would come here again if I return to Austin."
46,Buddy Owen,Local Guide·32 reviews·10 photos,,4 months ago,Always great. Doesn't disappoint.
47,Jonathan Mascaro,Local Guide·33 reviews·41 photos,,2 years ago,"Great food, great price. The brisket melt in your mouth and everything is tasty.
The cheddar macaronis and the potato salad are delicious too."
48,Reyna Juarez,Local Guide·64 reviews·118 photos,,2 years ago,The ribs are amazing!!! Falls right off the bone!!
49,Matt Kenney,Local Guide·94 reviews·202 photos,,3 years ago,"You can smell the bbq from about a block away.  They were limited on what was left at about 730 on a Wednesday, so you know it’s good.  The beans and ribs were tasty, but the brisket was what did it for me.  Soooo good.  Delicious post traveling dinner eating great bbq and listening to the blues. Definitely worth the stop."
50,Paul Yorki,Local Guide·152 reviews·261 photos,,2 years ago,Perfectly smoked brisket that requires no BBQ sauce to enjoy.  The sausage is the best without the grease but all the flavor.
51,Jean Steingreaber,11 reviews,,6 months ago,Yummy place to eat. Quick service.
52,Marco Reinhard,Local Guide·300 reviews·897 photos,,2 years ago,A firework of tasty food. A must if you were in the austin area!
53,Melissa Creamer,Local Guide·84 reviews·97 photos,,2 years ago,If you ever visit Austin this place is worth the visit. We had the beef ribs and Turkey. The smoke ring on the beef ribs was perfect. They were fall apart tender and juicy. We got a side of Mac and cheese and it was on point. Super cheesy and creamy. Next time I'm in Austin I will visit again.
54,Tisha Villarreal,Local Guide·31 reviews·4 photos,,9 months ago,Customer service was great. Friendly & fast service.  I didn't care for the food. Lots of fat in the ribs & brisket. Some ppl like that but I prefer leaner meat. The sausage casing was super chewy also. I'll stick to Southside Market.
55,TodBoy24,Local Guide·30 reviews,,3 months ago,Best bbq I've had in Austin so far.
56,Benjamin Kuester,Local Guide·21 reviews·1 photo,,4 years ago,"Really good BBQ, especially the double meat with the jalepeno sausage on top. Also, some of the best peach cobbler I’ve ever had."
57,Derek Deitsch,Local Guide·34 reviews·21 photos,,3 years ago,"Quintessential Texas bbq without the unreasonable wait to get through a line. The ribs are impeccable, and the sausage and brisket certainly aren’t bad either. Be careful because as with any bbq place, the cost can go up quickly. But it’s totally worth it!"
58,Jessica Z.,Local Guide·136 reviews·308 photos,,a year ago,I thought it would be better.  The ribs were hard to eat and stuck to the bone.  Disappointed.
59,Eric Johnson,179 reviews,,a month ago,Good food good service
60,Sean Keenan,Local Guide·135 reviews·258 photos,,3 years ago,Good quality bbq here! The only downside is that they were out of chicken & turkey when I got there at 8pm. The brisket was still good & I goit it double stacked with sausage. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area!
61,Ariel Goldberger,Local Guide·476 reviews·305 photos,,a year ago,"It's time to try one of the best bbq in town, always check what meat they are offering to get the fresh ones. Price is a bit high for quantity"
62,Mel Taber,Local Guide·92 reviews·38 photos,,2 years ago,Delicious! Definitely recommend the street corn.
63,Alex Stell,2 reviews,,7 months ago,"I’d give half a star if I could. I called to make a pick up order for some ribs and they told me they not taking pick up orders. When I show up, someone’s picking up an order, and then they choose to tell me they’re sold out of ribs. Was definitely a waste of time to try this place, and a failed attempt to get food."
64,Matt Burgess,Local Guide·46 reviews·11 photos,,6 months ago,"Some of the best BBQ, period. This place nevet dissapoints."
65,Victor Andino (AvatarXD),Local Guide·82 reviews·120 photos,,2 years ago,"Awesome brisket.  Great flavors, ribs falling of the bone."
66,Izak Kapi,"Local Guide·751 reviews·1,414 photos",,8 months ago,"Really good BBQ, the beef rib is great but hella expensive,  the fatty brisket is awesome the pork ribs are good. Over all we enjoyed our meal tremendously but it was the most expensive meal in our Austin visit."
67,Ryan Hoffnagle,Local Guide·18 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"While this might not be the BEST BBQ in town, it is always good, and fast! For me, this is my go to joint, and they now have BBQ chicken!"
68,Richie Brown,Local Guide·106 reviews·147 photos,,4 years ago,"Great menu, quick service."
69,Didi Richard,17 reviews,,5 months ago,"The food was good, the staff was very hospitable."
70,Narek Dshkhunyan,Local Guide·482 reviews·346 photos,,a year ago,The BBQ was so tender so you can't even pick it up with a fork (not that you should use one anyways). The drink choices are quite underwhelming though - only some weird wines and a few local beers. Very nice service!
71,Christian Tschoepe,Local Guide·153 reviews·223 photos,,a year ago,Seriously good brisket and sides
72,James Wallace,Local Guide·84 reviews·50 photos,,2 years ago,"We had the brisket, Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage, it was great.  The service was good and fast.  I will visit again the next time I am in Austin."
73,David Dais,Local Guide·133 reviews·13 photos,,8 months ago,"I had dinner here and while they are definitely good, in my opinion they aren't as good as Terry Black's BBQ, even though the prices are pretty much the same."
74,Michael Goodman,"Local Guide·219 reviews·1,096 photos",,a year ago,"Tried a little bit of everything here. It was super standard, really nothing interesting, definitely not worth going out of your way for, not even remotely.

The turkey was highly recommended by staff and it was dry AF. Don't bother.

Brisket and pulled pork didn't have great flavor, definitely needed bbq sauce (which was also boring). Sides were also standard.

No idea why this is so popular. There are so many better places in Austin for BBQ than this place.

It was reasonably priced."
75,Joan Childress-Greathouse,"Local Guide·179 reviews·2,014 photos",,3 years ago,"Very, very juicy and delicious BBQ! #Thatbrisketthough! The pork rib were really tender and tasty also. Good portion sizes and not too pricy."
76,Erik Pasco,Local Guide·55 reviews·30 photos,,8 months ago,"Meat! Very flavorful, fall apart. Smoked jalapeño sausage was fantastic as well. I’ll be back."
77,Graham Spell,Local Guide·352 reviews·390 photos,,4 years ago,"On a BBQ Tour. The brisket here is good & has a nice smoky oak taste but a little dry. The sauce is light and does not have much taste. The sausage is absolutely disgusting and not worth the $3 it cost. However, the pork ribs are excellent and worth trying. Was not impressed with their ""Norma Jeans Beans."""
78,Brandon Anderson,Local Guide·31 reviews,,8 months ago,Food was very good.  We had just about some of everything.  Customer service wasn't the best.
79,Carolina Guizar,15 reviews·8 photos,,4 years ago,BBQ done right. The sides are equally as good. It’s my favorite BBQ spot in Austin.
80,Darryl Hall,3 reviews·4 photos,,2 years ago,"Good BBQ,ring sausage is exceptional!!, good sides......"
81,Brenda Susanto Madsen,Local Guide·18 reviews·61 photos,,4 years ago,Tasty Brisket ever !! I love the ambience of the Place.. we went here today June 5 2017 to Honor and Salute the Edgar Black Jr Who has just Passed Away (1925-2017) May he RIP
82,Jon Reeves,99 reviews·103 photos,,a year ago,Great beef ribs and chunky potato salad
83,Dima Kaleganov,Local Guide·67 reviews·122 photos,,8 months ago,"Amazingly delicious barbecue. Definitely try ribs & fatty brisket, just the best"
84,Salvador “Chaba” Fdez.,Local Guide·192 reviews·434 photos,,2 years ago,"Best BBQ I tried in Austin, with superb service by Manager Juan! Exquisite smoked and roasted meat with a large selection of siders. Their mac & cheese seems simple but tastes extremely delicious!"
85,Jason Kilpatrick,Local Guide·52 reviews·8 photos,,8 months ago,"Had planned to hit lockhart, but time constraints had me downtown austin. Brisket was totally on point - rich even in the lean cut (gotta watch my figure). Jalapeno sausage was ground too fine for my texture liking but ok on flavor. 5* is due the brisket <3"
86,Trevor Collins,16 reviews,,a month ago,They ran out of everything at 6pm😒
87,Rafael Kaufmann,Local Guide·463 reviews·683 photos,,a year ago,"Great food. Maybe we got lucky, but zero wait!"
88,leo Youngblood,17 reviews,,7 months ago,Lean sliced brisket was outstanding.  Giant ribs were fatty.
89,Helen Hanna,Local Guide·124 reviews·180 photos,,a month ago,Excellent bbq
90,Lisa Limuel,Local Guide·281 reviews·18 photos,,9 months ago,"The beef was overcooked they advertised sweet corn and it had seasoning in it a spicy seasoning I just thought of it going to be some good buttery corn or like corn fresh corn  it wasn't a good experience, sorry!"
91,Eric Val,38 reviews·13 photos,,5 months ago,"Excellent brisket, I will be coming back"
92,Paul Hernandez,Local Guide·96 reviews·107 photos,,5 months ago,The barbecue was the worst that I had ever sampled in my life the fat cuts were unedible and they tasted like lighter fluid will never go back.
93,Karl Freyberg,Local Guide·32 reviews·32 photos,,2 years ago,"Best BBQ I have tried in Austin so far, highly recommended!!"
94,Ricardo Grenier,Local Guide·72 reviews·4 photos,,8 months ago,DDDDDelicious. Great smoke ring and bark on the beef ribs!!! Flavor Bomb!
95,Paul Heron,28 reviews·5 photos,,a year ago,"Wonderful experience. You get your meat, etc at a weigh scale and pay before sitting down at tables w benches. Place was more or less full. Friendly, relaxed staff, happy customers. Ribs and brisket were to die for. Texas style (not a lot of sauce). Family run since 1931–and feels like it. Highly recommend!!"
96,Tanner Lakey,Local Guide·8 reviews·57 photos,,a year ago,"The food was just not very good. I am no BBQ aficionado, but in the group of 10 that I was with going to Black's, nobody enjoyed their meal. The brisket was decently juicy and tender but it was incredibly salty. It tasted like generic BBQ from a chain other than the saltiness. May have just been an off day, but after being recommended to me by multiple people I really don't understand the appeal."
97,Linda Monti,12 reviews·4 photos,,a year ago,Paid 15$ for a pound of “ribs” that were delivered by Postmates that were literally skin with a sliver of meat. My friend got the pulled pork which was really good and good portioned. I would NOT recommend the ribs they were dry and just skin. BBQ was averagely good.
98,rod atkinson,48 reviews,,a month ago,Excellent bbq
99,John Vinueza,"Local Guide·377 reviews·1,207 photos",,2 years ago,Awesome Texas BBQ
100,Daniel C,Local Guide·22 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,"Flavourful, melt in your mouth meat at a fair price! Fantastic service. We had the fatty brisket and pork ribs and it was wonderful. I am from Houston so I tried the Mexican street corn as well, wasn't quite what I was hoping (a lot of liquid and a strong black pepper flavor) but I'm sure it is for someone. Reccomended!"
101,Elvis Ochoa,Local Guide·174 reviews·346 photos,,a year ago,We enjoyed the sides and the BBQ. This isn't the best BBQ place but its good.
102,Joshua Keith,"Local Guide·371 reviews·3,086 photos",,8 months ago,This BBQ place is a legend of brisket indulgence.
103,Allison L.,Local Guide·50 reviews·241 photos,,2 years ago,"Awesome little BBQ spot, it's a little hard to see from the street.

I got the brisket, beef rib, Mac n' cheese, and potato salad. The beef rib was probably my favorite part but it's definitely something to share at dinner unless you're super hungry. Totally felt like Fred Flintstone.

Brisket was okay, order it fatty and dunk it in sauce.

Sides were very good. I've yet to find a BBQ place in Austin that doesn't have awesome Mac n' cheese."
104,Eric Johnson,190 reviews,,2 months ago,Good pork ribs!
105,Krissy D M,15 reviews·1 photo,,3 years ago,Favorite place to eat in Austin. Brisket is so tender. Customer Service is great.
106,CC Li,Local Guide·66 reviews·64 photos,,3 years ago,Brisket is very juicy and tender. Sausage is amazing.
107,Landon Davila,40 reviews·18 photos,,5 months ago,Awesome bbq 😋 brisket on point
108,life with Jonathan,Local Guide·131 reviews·38 photos,,9 months ago,"Good, but not as good as the lockhart one. My brisket was cold but the sausage and sides were on point."
109,Gabriela-Beatrice Stoian,Local Guide·104 reviews·68 photos,,a year ago,"Just delicious. 👌The sweet-potato it's yummy, delicious food. 🤤"
110,Urvashi,Local Guide·19 reviews·7 photos,,4 years ago,"Having been to Black's BBQ in Lockhart, I was pleased that a location was in Austin. I only had the turkey with their delicious sides. The meat was tender and delicious. Highly recommended the mac 'n cheese and the sweet potato. If your thirsty they have some beers but I would recommend their lemonade slushy. They have a smaller menu than their Lockhart location (no chicken and possibly others) but the food is lovely."
111,charles pinkston,65 reviews·1 photo,,a month ago,Great bbq
112,Pat Fuller,11 reviews·6 photos,,2 years ago,So good I got the meat sweats.
113,Alex Ortiz,Local Guide·10 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,"I never tried the Austin location until today. I would always eat at the Lockhart location believing that the quality was the best there. Austin’s location puts up a serious fight. The brisket is tender and flavorful, super juicy and filling.

I would still suggest the Lockhart location for the historical experience as well, but go to the Austin location if you’re in for delicious BBQ in a convenient place."
114,Steve Brown,Local Guide·45 reviews·36 photos,,3 years ago,"Best BBQ I've ever eaten!
Staff were so helpful!"
115,Rabbitly Webdesign,Local Guide·66 reviews·440 photos,,5 years ago,They are ok... Their beef ribs are good. But there are better places in Austin specially if you are looking for turkey or sausages.
116,Warren Gillies,Local Guide·19 reviews·14 photos,,2 years ago,"Foods good, just try to visit on off hours or you might be in for a wait."
117,Cassy Clayman,Local Guide·33 reviews·17 photos,,2 years ago,It was a easy place to go and one of the few bbq places near the air bnb I was staying in..I had a brisket sandwich and it was a solid bbq sandwich! The staff who helped me was super great and advising what the restaurant was known for and I always appreciate good service like that!
118,RalphNCarol,Local Guide·30 reviews·156 photos,,3 years ago,Clean and friendly environment. Great BBQ
119,Errol Bonite,Local Guide·174 reviews·57 photos,,7 months ago,Once you enter the smells takeover and the food is out of control delicious
120,Gary Kee,Local Guide·111 reviews·163 photos,,2 years ago,Always go with the fatty brisket. Mac N cheese is good too.
121,Weston Rodberry,Local Guide·35 reviews·52 photos,,a year ago,The food was delicious. The wait line was out the door but if you order online you can pick it up using the side entrance (accessible entrance) and go to the cashier to pick up. Will definitely order again.
122,Jorge Cabre,1 review·2 photos,,2 years ago,"Amazing, Outstanding fatty brisque and pork ribs. If you are in town for just a few days and want to do the bbque thing, this is the place!"
123,Nicandro Silva,Local Guide·109 reviews·77 photos,,7 months ago,A place to enjoy one of the traditional dish in Texas.
124,Robert Rich,Local Guide·21 reviews·27 photos,,4 years ago,Their Mac n Cheese is so good!
125,shawn Chambers,9 reviews,,8 months ago,Nothing but the best and will continue to visit this place they are awesome.
126,Ben Brennan,Local Guide·158 reviews·777 photos,,3 years ago,Great BBQ get the brisket.
127,Katie Houston,Local Guide·49 reviews·142 photos,,a year ago,"My partner pulled up here for take out one day and a few minutes later comes out with an incredible agglomeration of meats, Mac, and slaw. He had real childlike wonder in his eyes and started explaining he couldn't help himself once he walked in! Even with social distancing he talked about how fun the atmosphere was and how nice the employees were. I'm a vegetarian and I LOVED the parts of the meal I could eat. My partner swears it was the best beef rib he had ever had. From the little bits we gave them, our dogs agree!"
128,Manuel T,10 reviews·27 photos,,2 years ago,Wonderful BBQ a bit pricey but I regret nothing. The family truly enjoys visiting Blacks when we are in Austin.
129,Kelly S,Local Guide·64 reviews·94 photos,,a year ago,"This place has become a regular stop for us. We can't get enough BBQ, and what brings us back to this one is the prices. The quality is good and the prices are better. My only gripe is brisket is hit or miss (lean or juicy... lean seems to be a bit too dry and juicy sometimes a bit too fatty). But usually we strike lucky with the juicy not being overly fatty (just maybe get a big extra ;) )
We love the sausage and the deserts are amazing! Definitely worth checking out if yoire looking for BBQ on a budget."

135,King Bosca,Local Guide·132 reviews·71 photos,,2 years ago,"The college games on and near loved ones, wouldn't have been a better Saturday/Sunday til peach cobbler was ordered without the crust... & By accident on my tab., Or did you do that. Anyhow, the location here is different to be ducked off in & around. It was a pleasure."
136,Brent Vawdrey,Local Guide·38 reviews·170 photos,,2 years ago,"Food was great but I didn't care for the stand in line (that went out the door) & order at counter experience. I simply wanted another beer, but I would have had to go back outside & get back in the 20+ minute line to order. Vibe felt touristy vs local favorite. I would go back for the food but would be strategic about time of day to avoid the line."

149,Lisha Fischer (My Home & Garden),Local Guide·18 reviews·5 photos,,3 years ago,"I use to love this Blacks location, until today.  I should have ask for a sample taste of the brisket before I purchased it.  I looked fine when he was slicing it, but maybe he switched it when i turned my head or something.  After getting home I took one BIG bite and spit it out.  The meat tasted like it have some chemicals on it, it was horrible, the bread fell apart as you can see it the picture.  It looks nothing like what I saw him slice.  Does this meat look like Blacks normal juicy brisket.  NO, the meat crumbled and fell apart in top of tasting like chemicals.  I paid over $7 bucks for this!!! I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN. Now that I thought about it, the hispanic man was looking at me very weird the whole time I was there. I'm suspicious he did something to that meat when my back was turned.  Next time I'll drive to Elgin if not Lockhart. I attempt to post a picture but for some odd reason it will not upload.  Maybe because I gave it a one STAR."

152,Shamarie Jaminson,Local Guide·59 reviews·18 photos,,3 years ago,Food was incredible. Had chopped beef. Which was like a sloppy joe only with slow cooked brisket that was baked in BBQ sauce. Mac and cheese on the side.
153,Jessica Miller,Local Guide·406 reviews·482 photos,,4 years ago,"We got brisket, mac and cheese, coleslaw, and pecan cobbler. Everything was perfectly tender and delicious. Prepare to wait in line!"

155,Debabu Geberehiwot,1 review,,a year ago,"The criteria I used to evaluate this restaurant is: price, quality of food, customer service, and cleanliness. I rated these 0 out of 10. Price:7, Quality of food: 10, Customer service:9, cleanliness: 9. The price is a little bit on the expensive side, so this wouldn’t be a place I would come to very often but on special occasions. With all these things into consideration, I would give this restaurant a 9 out of 10. This restaurant is located in downtown and is close to other places that are waking distance; so one can go on a nice stroll after getting some food!"
156,BUTTERS BLACK,30 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,"This place was DELICIOUS! I really enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, jalapeño sausage link & the mac n cheese! I would definitely go back next time I'm in Austin!"
157,Laura S,4 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,Outstanding brisket and the macaroni was the best I had in a restaurant so far. Love this place. Only been here one other time but had family come in from Ohio visitimg this week and made sure they ate here.
158,Sonia Smith,Local Guide·22 reviews·13 photos,,2 years ago,"I had lean brisket 1/3lb. (About 3 slices), a piece of white meat chicken breast, individual  side of potato salad and macaroni.
Brisket was good but a bit salty, not dry.
Chicken was tender and moist.
Potato had mustard and was very creamy, really good. Very fresh
Macaroni was creamy and delicious. Very fresh.
Atmosphere was casual. We went at 11am for lunch. The place got packed quickly with a line out the door to order.
It appeared clean and orderly.
The staff was friendly and helpful in assisting me with my order since it was my first time here
Food is pricey. I paid a little over $15 for my meal without a paid drink."
159,Courtney Lindsey-Patterson,40 reviews·3 photos,,a year ago,Everything was good. I’m a barbecue lover; the meat was very tender—NO pull(tug) on the ribs or brisket. Great atmosphere and customer service.
160,Alejandro Martinez,Local Guide·55 reviews·90 photos,,4 years ago,"This was the first time I had ever gone to Black's and MAN, was it good!!  I didn't know what to choose and I really wasn't there for the leisure time, so I was going to go for the default, a brisket sandwich combo.  When it was my turn to slide on over to the register, my eyes fell upon the most beautiful thing on the face of this Earth- the Black's BBQ Frito Pie.  It was heavenly!!!  The meat was moist, flavorful, tender, the beans pintoey, the fritos crispy, overall, it was out of this world!!  Did I mention the mexican street corn side??  Wow!  I've been to Mexican street vendors hawking their elote.  I try to go every time I visit Mexico.  There was a lot at stake calling their creation Mexican Street Corn.  I ordered it and hoped it would not let me down.  It did not.  I can't wait to go back.  I will definitely be returning, with other people this time.  Everyone deserves to dream about Black's BBQ Frito Pie."
161,A B,9 reviews,,a year ago,"Very good BBQ. The brisket is amazing and the pecan cobbler is delicious. However, it's worth noting that this place is ADA compliant, but not ADA friendly. We had someone on a walker and he had trouble getting into the building, trouble getting into the benches to eat (there are no chairs), and we had to wait for quite some time for a table to clear, which meant he was just standing there on bad legs with nowhere to sit and wait. It definitely put a damper on an otherwise pleasant experience."
162,Brian Perdue,Local Guide·81 reviews·101 photos,,a year ago,One of several pro-level barbecue joints in Austin. The fatty brisket is my favorite.

165,Carlos Rosales,6 reviews,,a year ago,Was kind of bland if you ask me personally. Very very mild smoke flavor and the sausage texture was almost raw. Brisket needed salt or seasoning

I was excited to have a closer location,  but it was horrible.   This brisket had no flavor whatsoever and the meat was so hard and chewy from being so over cooked.  We ordered 10#s so we could have a ton of leftovers.   I should have known better.     2 stars for the polite employees."
171,Damion Fisher,Local Guide·23 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,Delicious Barbecue! Well worth the price. Get the Sharp Cheddar Mac & Cheese on the side.

176,B Ram,Local Guide·132 reviews·8 photos,,2 years ago,"Beef ribs are phenomenal!! Good flavor, very moist and juicy! Brisket is very good... Smokey and full flavor! Pork ribs were good but not as moist as it should be. Sausage's are good in flavor and cooked well! Peach cobbler is very good!! Not quite to the level of Franklin's Barbecue in Austin but considering the 3 hour wait at Franklin vs.  just walking in and getting your food quickly.... Enjoy!!!"
177,Matthew Nolte,Local Guide·92 reviews·88 photos,,10 months ago,Same great quality that you will find at the original location.

180,David Mc,Local Guide·73 reviews·38 photos,,a year ago,I would've given it 5 stars but the staff wasn't overly friendly. The que was great though! I had the lean brisket and it had a tasty bark. The beans were good and so was the slaw.

187,Darren Thornton,Local Guide·239 reviews·255 photos,,2 years ago,"Nothing special. I've lived in Texas for 3 years now and haven't had BBQ that's anything worth writing home about. It's worth writing a Google review about though for those beautiful points. But yeah, the plus about this place is that parking is easy and free. The Mac and cheese was good too. Brisket was sub par."
188,Elizabeth Wait,Local Guide·43 reviews·13 photos,,2 years ago,"Just go here. The food here was delicious! I left feeling like I was going to explode!

193,J Large,1 review,,a year ago,Today was my first time eating a Black's bbq and i have to say i was not impressed. The beef was extremely greasy and fatty and not really good of flavor. The chicken was super dry i couldn't swallow it but i can say i enjoyed the turkey though. I really had high hopes for the food because i heard nothing but good things about it but honestly it was over priced and a big let down.

198,Farris Peter Kamel,51 reviews·4 photos,,2 years ago,"5 Stars all day! One of the best Briskets and Ribs I've ever had. Pork ribs were fall off the bone, and the Brisket was melt in your mouth. Great bark and rub. Try the green bean casserole and banana pudding. A+. Look forward to returning soon."
199,Carol Gonzalez,2 reviews,,a year ago,"We love the food here but they really need to accept orders by phone. We called and they directed us to door dash, favor, or online.  We used Favor and after an hour Favor texted us that they didn’t have runners. We called back to Blacks and they said the order hadn’t even been placed. Total waste of time. This all could have been avoided. Unfortunately we won’t be eating here as a take out option."

204,Richard Hong,Local Guide·19 reviews·15 photos,,a year ago,"Damn good BBQ in the state of Texas! Highly recommend and  will definitely come back for seconds. Brisket and sausage are my personal recommendations. Wish we had this good bbq in San Antonio. Don’t skip the sides either, get the cream corn and pinto beans."
205,Wendy Eames,Local Guide·79 reviews·27 photos,,a year ago,"Very good. We've lived here for decades & have eaten at pretty much every bar-b-q place in Central Texas, including the original Black's. Usually the offshoot branches aren't nearly as good as the original, but I would say this one is awfully close. We shared a beef rib and a mix of lean/fatty brisket, both are very good. We liked their sauce, the sides that we had, potato salad & coleslaw, were good, standard fare, what you would expect at a barbecue place. If I was rating the meat alone, it'd be 5 stars."
206,Abraham Qureshi,Local Guide·44 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,probably the best BBQ I've had!!!
207,Marcus Davila,8 reviews,,a year ago,This is hands down the best bbq I've had EVER!!  My favorite bbq place by far. If you have time or are in the area I highly recommend Black's BBQ! Worth every cent that's for sure. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is simply due to the guy cutting the meat the night my girlfriend and I went attitude. Not sure what was going on with him but his attitude was leads than par. I've been several times before then and everything was great. Might had just been an off night. I recommend this place strongly if you're looking for great bbq!!
208,Angel Prado,Local Guide·25 reviews·42 photos,,a year ago,"Third Black's I've visited, only missing New Braunfels at this point. Still the best damn barbeque I've had in the entire state."

212,Lane Guitzkow,Local Guide·74 reviews·27 photos,,2 years ago,"What can I say....this particular Blacks location is a regular stop for me. I like the smallness of it and the BBQ can't be beat. For me there brisket is the best in Austin, just the right smokey flavor. I like it all but usually do 1/3lb of brisket, a link of cheddar jalapeno sausage, small tater salad, and a drink. Enjoy Y'all!"
213,Hamed Samadi,Local Guide·155 reviews·541 photos,,2 years ago,I like Black’s BBQ as it’s close to my office and can meet the crave. The turkey that I tried here is one of the best comparing with other places that I’ve been. Brisket and Sausage are good too however there are still better options in town.
214,Juan Uribe,Local Guide·15 reviews,,6 months ago,Best bbq in town!
215,Beth Paris,11 reviews,,2 years ago,BBQ pork ribs with coleslaw and Mac & Cheese was so good. I would go back in a heartbeat! Friendly service! Don’t forget the peach cobbler for dessert.
216,Chet Ragsdale,Local Guide·115 reviews·118 photos,,a year ago,"Great pinto beans and tater salad! Sausage was excellent, brisket good. I want to try their ribs next and the sauce is just right. Mix in Texas favoritrs Big Red or Ice Tea and you can't go wrong."

223,James Neal,Local Guide·33 reviews,,2 years ago,"If you don't want to stand in line all morning, this is the best BBQ brisket you can get: it's smoky, tender, well-rendered, and consistently good. I can't speak for the ribs or sausage, but I hear those are good as well. The sides are tasty, but also very rich when paired with the already very hearty meats, so keep that in mind. If I were making one suggestion, it would be to add some lighter options there. That aside, this is a great place to try Austin BBQ, arguably the best when you factor in all the waiting you'd be doing at Franklin or La Barbecue."
224,Hannah Barber,8 reviews,,2 years ago,"I had Black's BBQ for the first time for a birthday gift. A family member shipped their brisket and ribs to my current home in Washington state. Not only did arrive quick, it was incredible! I have had a lot of barbecue  since I am from the south, but this might be the best brisket I have ever had even after being shipped across the country and reheated in the oven. There aren't as many barbecue restaurants in this area of the country, so having the option to have it shipped to you is wonderful. I would absolutely order this again, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves good barbecue!"
225,Lance McByers,Local Guide·30 reviews,,10 months ago,"Uses to be one of my favorites, but it's not as good as it used to be.....bland"
226,Caitlin Davis,8 reviews,,a year ago,"First off my husband ordered curbside and as soon as we called when we pulled up to the restaurant they told us to go in which isn’t curbside service at all. The employees were rude and not helpful when picking up the food. Overall the food was not worth what we paid for. We ordered lean brisket and pretty much the whole order was extremely fatty to where there wasn’t even any meat on most of it. The Mexican corn was like soup, and the potato salad tasted store bought. Not good at all! I normally don’t write reviews unless there is a reason to, in this case don’t waste your money when the quality is not as good as other bbq restaurants. I’m speaking specifically about the Guadalupe location in Austin. I haven’t tried any of the other locations."

233,Adam Graham,Local Guide·44 reviews·4 photos,,2 years ago,"Texas BBQ with all the classic fixings. New spots, same great taste. Fatty or lean they've got spoke rings for days. Plus he gave me a burnt end for free. I see you.
I had turkey, beef ribs, pork ribs and brisket. Brisket was my favourite. Ribs are dramatic for the insta though."

238,J D,Local Guide·128 reviews·111 photos,,2 years ago,"Had the pork ribs and the lean brisket. The ribs are small and the meat is not very flavorful. The BBQ sauce was very good. The macaroni and cheese is very good and creamy. The potato salad is delicious as well. Very expensive!! $17 for my meal, with no drink. There was also a dead fly in the pickles."
239,Andrew Schawel,Local Guide·70 reviews·508 photos,,3 years ago,"Long (and slow) lines, but worth the wait. They had only sold out of the chicken at 4:00pm. The brisket is a can't miss, they offer an option of lean or fatty brisket. The fatty brisket was moist and tender, I found the lean brisket to be a little bit dry. The pork spare ribs were good, although you might need to be picky about which pieces they give you. I asked for 3 ribs and one was a half-size end piece that was on the dry side. The Mac and cheese is amazing, especially the bits with the golden crust from the top. The baked beans are forgettable, they tasted like raw paprika and needed salt. Skip the banana pudding, next time I'll try one of the cobblers. Fair prices, delicious and definitely worth a visit."
240,#staciesfight Dystonia,Local Guide·39 reviews·2 photos,,2 years ago,Food was delicious. The restaurant accommodated me in my wheelchair but fellow patrons were not pleased that they had to share their space. Just be aware that seating is limited but there are additional tables outside

244,Noelle Hall,"Local Guide·372 reviews·1,187 photos",,2 years ago,Austin is the place for BBQ and this joint is pretty solid. No bad lines. You might wait 20 minutes. Brisket was the best thing here. Plus the spicy BBQ sauce was amazing. The pulled pork was awful. And the sides were just okay.
245,Amanda Star (Mandy Star),Local Guide·74 reviews·29 photos,,3 years ago,Expect to pay a lot for some good quality BBQ. The meat is amazing and tenderly delicious. If you have some extra cash and would like to treat yourself I would highly recommend this place. The staff is kind and the atmosphere is great. Be sure to check for long wait lines prior to going because the lines can be very long. The sauce is also amazing. Would totally budget for this and go again.

253,Kathryn Evans,Local Guide·36 reviews·33 photos,,2 years ago,"This place was great! We got there at about 1230 today (a saturday) and there was a line out the door. We didn't wait too long to get inside though. Come prepared to find a seat out back because it's a relatively small dining area and the tables indoors were constantly full. The staff was very friendly though! Not a bad price, pretty typical for barbecue.  It's not supposed to be cheap. Highly recommend the fatty brisket, macaroni and cheese, and potato salad. Cant wait to come back next time we're in town!"
254,Gabriel Serna,2 reviews,,2 years ago,"First time eating here. All of their side options sounded amazing. Especially the street corn! Growing up in the valley, I had to try it and I was more than impressed with it. The butcher that chopped up my brisket was very generous with the cuts. Highly recommend for anyone looking for great BBQ!"
255,Chris K.,Local Guide·30 reviews·75 photos,,3 years ago,"Unbelievably good barbecue. The service is also exceptional here. So, I have no doubt that everything on the menu is unsurpassed by other bbq joints. However, I wasn't able to try the pulled pork or beef ribs but I'm not complaining. Now I have an excuse to go back to Austin and stuff my face with more slow smoked meat at Black's. We got a few pounds of brisket, pork ribs, and sausage and brought it back to our hotel room. We opened everything up in the aluminum pan they provided and just dug in with our bear hands, the way God intended us to eat meat. Honestly, it was an emotional experience. You really, really need to eat the fat brisket. That one is the best I've ever had. If you decide to eat their brisket on site, they have plenty of benches and paper towel rolls inside, and a good size patio outside. You just order what you want (by weight for brisket, ribs and turkey) and they carve the meat up right in front of you on a giant chopping block. They are also opened 8 days a week which is super convenient."
256,Ben “Exploration Journey” Leal,18 reviews,,11 months ago,"Great service, friendly staff and delicious BBQ and side orders!!!!"
257,Zachary Brenneman,Local Guide·24 reviews,,2 years ago,"This past weekend, my family and I went to Black's Barbecue in Austin.  We have now been to this location 3 separate times, and each time they have exceeded our expectations.  The outdoor seating is a nice added touch.  The meats are top notch as always, but what keeps us coming back is the wide variety of sides.  Although, the massive beef rib is nothing to be messed with."
258,Cherie Johanson,Local Guide·22 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"I have never tasted BBQ this good ever! Super smoky flavor, excellent spices used and their street corn is absolutely wonderful. I am going back again tonight! It's so worth it!!! The smoked turkey, brisket, ribs, pulled pork are to die for. It's by the pound sonic you want to try small amounts (like 2 ribs and 3 slices of brisket or whatever) you can without breaking the bank and they let you taste it too! I'm hooked. Now, if I can get them to Vancouver, Washington 😀."
259,Steve Bradt,Local Guide·134 reviews·6 photos,,2 years ago,Great TX BBQ!  Pleasant outdoor seating available.  Very popular sport though.  Give yourself some time to wait.  Worth it though.  Get the giant beef rib!
260,Max Pietsch (Max),Local Guide·482 reviews·429 photos,,2 years ago,"TLDR I’d get the lean brisket with a side of beans if I went again. Also I’d get one of the BBQ sauces since they have a couple.

The lean brisket is usually excellent. It was too dry one of the times I went but I think that can happen anywhere every once in a while.

The beef ribs are a bit too fatty for me but are definitely an experience and worth trying at least once. They’re also sort of expensive.

One thing I’ve noticed about the brisket and ribs here is that they sometimes taste a little salty. It’s neither good nor bad just something unique. Maybe “smoked” is a more fitting adjective than “salty” as it’s not just purely salty.

The beans and chicken are very good, too. Chicken is always bland compared to brisket but theirs was fresh and moist so it was good as far as chicken goes."
261,Melissa Belila,Local Guide·46 reviews·10 photos,,a month ago,Delicious!
262,Steven Dale,Local Guide·37 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,"The bbq is awesome, the sides are so-so. But then again, you don't go there for the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes."
263,ZEPOL cisco Kid,Local Guide·54 reviews,,a month ago,Exclnt.
264,Julio Caballero,Local Guide·71 reviews,,a year ago,Only tried the brisket and mac and cheese. It was super yummy!
265,Chris Madsen,Local Guide·92 reviews·11 photos,,4 years ago,"I love good BBQ. I tried this place out and at first was a little taken aback by the price. Its easy to drop more than 20 dollars for one person. But the food is amazing. The sides are pretty tasty, the ribs were huge and perfectly smoked. The brisket is by far the best I have ever had. I will be back many times I am sure just for this reason."

269,Nate Finch,Local Guide·107 reviews·8 photos,,3 years ago,"This is the best barbecue in had so far in Texas. The sides, prices and menu are better. The brisket is really good, and the turkey is great. The staff is helpful, and the environment is better than most others I've been to. Definitely go here."
270,Rachel G. Talamantez,3 reviews,,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere... Great service... And the food... Oh forget about it! The coleslaw was perfect... Not too vinegary and not too sweet... And the potato salad was on point! The turkey was great... However, the lean brisket was a little fatty but great flavor! Definitely a come back place!"
271,Kiara Craig,Local Guide·37 reviews·49 photos,,2 years ago,"Recently visited on a trip to Austin. I tried the fat and lean brisket, pork spare ribs, and potato salad. The fatty brisket was great, and I would recommended it over the lean brisket. The ribs were perfectly cooked, however I am not a big of the Texas style ""Salt and Pepper""  ribs and would have liked more diverse spices. The potato salad had a great taste, but I bigger fan of ""chucky"" potato salad as opposed the mashed potato-like consistency of this particular potato salad. Overall, this restaurant executed its menu very well and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to try true Texas BBQ."
272,Sam Jainer,5 reviews,,4 months ago,Worth the wait!
273,Mike Dunn,30 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"Very good BBQ! And, the sides are good, too. I was looking forward to their screamed corn, but not today. No worries. The brisket, garlic sausage and ribs were quite enough!!"
274,Sandra Lee Sosa,Local Guide·48 reviews·267 photos,,2 years ago,Great food at a great price. Beef was flavorful and at a decent price. Parking is limited. Mac and Cheese is Great! Tea is good too. Good environment. Friendly staff.

278,K. McQueen,Local Guide·67 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"The turkey was suspect, had a funny smell to it. The sweet potatoes lacked flavor. Mac n cheese was creamy. The side portions are super small."
279,The Lastiri's,Local Guide·69 reviews·6 photos,,a year ago,Great food! Definitely a must try bbq place when you're in town!
280,John Peters,6 reviews,,a year ago,"I remember when I used to go to this place to find old books and records when it was a Half Price Books location....Hailing from a most famous town of BBQ - Lockhart, TX.  How could you go wrong.  This is my spouse's favorite BBQ on all of planet earth.  I'm glad the family decided to expand in my direction.  Go Beef!  Get anything here.  And, if you don't like it.  Try harder.  This is what good food taste like."
281,kelle thorsen,Local Guide·49 reviews·42 photos,,a year ago,"Absolutely perfect sliced brisket. Lovely perfectly fatty, deliciousness♡ The best I've ever had!"
282,Stephen Herrlich,Local Guide·40 reviews·4 photos,,2 years ago,Not really worth it. They made it sound good but the meat is meh at best. Line was out the door and we had to wait about 45 minutes. They also had a short supply of food. Couldn't get what I wanted
283,Zach West,Local Guide·22 reviews,,a year ago,"Easily some of the best barbeque in Austin. Probably the best sausage, bar none. Really spectacular."
284,Leah Crow,1 review,,2 years ago,"We came from Waco to eat at Blacks on Sunday morning. We got there a little early, thinking there might be a line, there wasn’t but we were welcomed in about 10 min early. The original man who helped us was nice and happy, and then another employee came out and was mouthing off at him about opening early, how he wanted to chill for 10 min longer and take a dump. I kid you not.  He said it at least twice. Where we could hear him, and then grumpily rang us up.  The other guy tried to shush him but it didn’t work... anyway, kinda put a damper on the experience. We spent $50, it was pretty good. Very salty, but tender and sticky like it should be.  I won’t be back, but I can tick it off my list of bbq joints to visit."
285,Marcel Nietlisbach,13 reviews,,a year ago,Pick up was fast. Food was awesome and pretty cheap!
286,e c,Local Guide·28 reviews·34 photos,,a year ago,"The taste was so good, I like the lean and my wife likes the moist and she loved the taste too!"
287,Draven Reel,1 review,,2 years ago,"Best time I've had with my family since I've lived in Austin. Best BBQ around, great beer and music. How could you not love this place?!"
288,Matt Johns,Local Guide·21 reviews,,2 years ago,Fatty and lean brisket were both exactly what you want in brisket. Flavorful and great texture. And one of the best parts was they didn't phone it in on the sides. I tried the potato salad and the coleslaw and both left me wanting more. Only reason I gave 4 stars is I need to try more Texas bbq spots first.
289,rocknbiron,6 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,The brisket was fabulous.  Sausage was a little dry.
290,Hephen Stolland,7 reviews,,a year ago,Great food. Love this place.
291,Bruce Bowman,5 reviews,,a year ago,Very expensive. Sausage was dry and crumbly. Sauce was watery and bland. Nothing about this makes me want to go back again. Too many other good places for barbecue for far less.
292,Gaurav Kumar,Local Guide·42 reviews,,2 years ago,The brisket was super good. Soft meat but don’t try the pork as it’s not done properly. I would always come back for the brisket. It’s totally worth if eaten Hot!
293,Read Breeland,Local Guide·590 reviews·230 photos,,2 years ago,Best BBQ I've had.  I'm from Biloxi MS so maybe I just know good seafood?   Would recommend this place based on my taste buds.
294,Gabriel Graham,1 review,,a year ago,"We asked for fatty brisket but they trimmed off the fat and a good amount of the bark. The brisket turned out to be really dry. The Mexican street corn seemed like it was just creamed corn with barbecue sauce mixed in, so it was weirdly sour. The best thing about the meal was, unfortunately, the pickles.

We had a pretty bad experience over all. Go to Terry Black’s, La BBQ, or, if you have 5 hours in the early morning to kill, Franklin’s."
295,Yvonne S,Local Guide·7 reviews,,2 years ago,"Enjoyed a giant beef rib and quarter chicken, with mac n' cheese and potato salad on the side. Added two beers and the total bill was $42. We were stuffed, and still had leftovers to take home. The service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant was clean. Looking forward to making a toasted sandwich with the leftovers tomorrow...!"
296,Drew Maclean,Local Guide·42 reviews·72 photos,,4 years ago,"This was tasty BBQ. I went with the beef rib, it weighed multiple pounds and they did a pretty good job. I got a beer with it and it came to $40; too pricey for what I got. I only got it because the person before me ordered one and it looked amazing but it was much smaller. I wish I asked for a smaller rib; mine would have fed a small family. I look forward to checking out their main location to see if it is better."
297,Aaron Taylor,Local Guide·350 reviews·790 photos,,a year ago,Great portion size and decent BBQ. Definitely go for the fatty brisket over lean and the turkey is done right. Sides are wonderful with green beans my top choice.
298,Jennifer Nutting,1 review,,3 years ago,"Visiting from San Diego and just happened upon this place.  Amazing. Pork ribs and moist brisket made to perfection, not to mention the one beef rib my husband consumed. Mark was a very gracious host and took us on a tour of the smokehouse. We will definitely be back for years and years to come!"
299,jason Valdez,7 reviews,,3 years ago,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience. Food was tasty, people were friendly. Good prices. Not a big line. Definitely will go back here!!"
300,John Carpenter,Local Guide·105 reviews·40 photos,,2 years ago,"I love Black's, but it can be a chore to eat here. Parking is somewhat limited, even if you take advantage of the street and parking lot across the street. During busier times, the line can be out the door. If the weather won't let you take advantage of outdoor seating, it will be tough to find a place to enjoy your BBQ. Enough about the cons, I keep jumping through these hoops because the food is so tasty and the workers are friendly and personable. Brisket/sausage/chicken/ribs and more. Plenty of sides to choose from. Don't even get me started on the Mac and cheese. That golden delight came straight from heaven. If you still have room in your stomach after all of that - there are a couple of 'Texan' desserts to choose from as well. Long story short - find that parking spot, wait in the line, find a table/get take out and you will be rewarded with the best Texan cuisine."
301,Jon M,Local Guide·108 reviews·39 photos,,2 years ago,"First time having Texas BBQ and I'm all in. Brisket, jalepeno cheddar sausage ring and GIANT beef rib were amazing. Best mac and cheese I've ever had. Like seriously. I can't get over how good the mac and cheese was."
302,Stefanie Herman,Local Guide·86 reviews,,9 months ago,If you’re reading reviews trying to decide if you should go eat there just go do it
303,Alex Tran,"Local Guide·531 reviews·8,275 photos",,3 years ago,Black's BBQ is by far the best barbecue I've had in Texas. Their turkey is amazing and delicious. The brisket is very tender and cooked perfectly. Their sauce is housemaid and goes with everything. I really love their mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in Austin Texas. Thank you!
304,Charlotte Becker,7 reviews·1 photo,,3 years ago,"This was my first time eating there and I have to day the food was amazing. I had the pork ribs and they were pull off the bone tender, also had the regular sausage,and items just right. I also had the potato salad and the Mexican corn. All the food was awesome. I was here visiting my daughter and she took me here to eat and I definitely will be back"
305,Teddy Davidson,Local Guide·166 reviews·639 photos,,2 years ago,Best barbecue ever!!! Totally worth it.
306,DeWayne Gaines,Local Guide·73 reviews·21 photos,,10 months ago,"I did not get any flavor except oil from the brisket. Also, I did not care for the ribs nor the sides."
307,Kaitlyn Swing,Local Guide·24 reviews·5 photos,,a year ago,Jersey girl visiting Texas for a work conference. Of course had to find a BBQ place for dinner. Luckily we went on a weekday closer to closing time and didn't have to wait and had a table for all of us. Really great sandwich and great BBQ sauce.
308,Terry Tyner,Local Guide·112 reviews·12 photos,,2 years ago,"Not sure why so many people recommended this place.  Went there looking for some good brisket. You get all your food at the counter as soon as you walk in.  $18 got me supposedly a half pound of lean brisket.  The sides are separate.  I got slaw and Mac.  The brisket was ok, but nothing to get really excited about.  I have definitely had it cheaper and better.  The slaw was good and the Mac was good.  Neither was outstanding though.  The people working the counter were pretty friendly."
309,LVS269,Local Guide·292 reviews·806 photos,,a year ago,"Had the Fred Flintstone beef rib, brisket & pulled pork, & a link. All around good taste... I hyped it up in my head for the last yr or two wanting to go & finally getting the chance I was expecting a knock out..."
310,Art Hill,Local Guide·206 reviews·141 photos,,4 years ago,"Like must good BBQ places, the line is stupid long.  I don't understand why.  However, the BBQ is great.  I think the brisket was near perfection.  The turkey was a little dry.  The spare ribs were good.  I really liked spicy creamed corn.  The Mac was good and the green beans were fine."
311,Adam Guymon,Local Guide·282 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,Its good barbecue but definitely not the best in Austin
312,Rudy C. Zamora,11 reviews,,a year ago,"Came in from out of town, placed our order online, received prompt curbside service, and the food was amazing! We had the pork ribs, brisket sandwich, beans and potato salad, definitely deserves a 5 star review!"
313,Dave Pruiett,13 reviews,,a year ago,"We had been looking forward to our visit after watching a show on the Food Network which reviewed the original location in Lockhart. Unfortunately most everything that was positive about the Lockhart location was missing at the Austin location. The place was not busy yet we had to work hard to get the attention of the two gentleman working the counter. When we did speak with their customer service skills were definitely lacking.

We ordered the brisket, ribs, and two types of sausage as well as the Mac and cheese and a side of beans. The brisket and sausage were cold (no exaggeration) and the ribs were warm (not hot) and fatty. Had the food been served warm/hot it would have been much better as the cook and flavor were perfect. We ate about 1/3 of our $38 meal, threw the rest in the trash, and left.

Based on this experience we will never return to Blacks. Such a let-down."
314,Stacy Warren,83 reviews·1 photo,,9 months ago,"Ordering process not too efficient, but the food is well worth the wait. Yum!"
315,Bracin K,Local Guide·385 reviews·216 photos,,a year ago,This is the Guadalupe location. They have Edgar's sausage! However I just went there again on 11/2 and the sausage has gone from the size it has been for decades to the size of a tiny ring. Same price if course. Really dissappointing charging same for a 1/4 of the product.
316,Jonathan Burrows,Local Guide·128 reviews·9 photos,,2 years ago,"I wish I could go 5 stars but I take the blame for not taking a moment and addressing the issue on the mamouth beef rib.. Im sure they would have given me another that maybe had a bit more beef.. I own it.   On the other hand, my sons brisket sandwich was great.  Great customer response when I wrote the owner.. If back in Austin will definitely try again!"
317,Bjorn and Karen Brown,3 reviews,,2 years ago,"I wish we had tummy space for more. This Canadian family was in brisket heaven. Hope to come back again.

Would love to have you up north."
318,Eric O'Dell,Local Guide·308 reviews·472 photos,,2 years ago,"My wife and I stopped here on a weekend trip to Dallas. Line was out the door. The food was good, but not the best barbecue we had on the trip. It is one of the easier Texas barbecue places to get into in the city though."
319,mark adams,Local Guide·107 reviews·128 photos,,3 years ago,I'm very picky about my barbecue. But they have at the best sausage. And their brisket is always perfect. They have a lean brisket and a fatty brisket they're both very good and always consistent I highly recommend this place.
320,Matthew Holladay,Local Guide·117 reviews·87 photos,,2 years ago,High expectations were had before going to The Original Black's but my wife and I both agree that it is a bit overrated and would much rather have Terry Black's if staying within the Black family. The brisket was too dry to our liking and didn't have very good flavor. The flavor profile was more in line with a roast instead of smoked bbq. We are glad that we tried it but we have other favorites around Austin.
321,Laura Wilsmann,Local Guide·44 reviews,,2 years ago,Visited earlier this year in vacation. Awesome food and good prices too! Only downside was it was super busy.
322,Diana Cañas,4 reviews,,a year ago,"Over hyped and expensive. I was really craving BBQ and heard a lot of hype about this place so I decided to go. I went in around 5:30pm and it took about 45 minutes to get to the front of the line and get my food. The line was at the door, so not too long and it took too long for it to move. They were probably 8-10 people in front of me. When I got the front, the people weren’t helpful when I asked for recommendations so I decided to get one serving of the meats (brisket, ribs and sausage) and two sides. I spent $30 and was excited to eat. Once I started eating though, I was disappointed. The ribs were just fat, no meat. The brisket was burnt - they gave me the ends - not worth $10. Then I got one flavor of each of the sausages since I’m a huge fan. The sausage was not good. I did not like the texture or flavor. The two sides I got were coleslaw and potato salad. The coleslaw was okay and potato salad decent. I was not impressed and would not go back."
323,Roger Leung,Local Guide·143 reviews·152 photos,,3 years ago,The brisket is awesome.
324,Bill Moran,Local Guide·17 reviews,,3 years ago,"Wow - one great rib.  And that's all you'll need.  (Maybe more than enough!)  At first I thought it would be fatty and I'd have to pick through it.  But once I started attacking it, I realized the ""fat"" just melts in your mouth and adds the flavor.  Excellent version."
325,Josh Williams,Local Guide·277 reviews·301 photos,,4 years ago,Came to Austin on a BBQ tour and had to stop in for some brisket.  They did not disappoint.  The only disappointment was when I had finished all the wet and lean brisket was it was so good I went and ordered some more.  The sides were also really good and the kiddos loved the Mac and cheese.  Definitely a fantastic BBQ joint!!!
326,Jean Garcia,39 reviews·7 photos,,4 years ago,Brisket sandwich and Mexican street corn were delicious!! Love the atmosphere. Was getting my car detailed and found my way here. I'm not driving to Lockhart anymore!!! Rene was very friendly... great customer service!
327,Jamie Woods,Local Guide·10 reviews·1 photo,,4 years ago,"The ORIGINAL Black's,  on Guadalupe,  is the one to beat in Austin. When you don't need sauce to eat their ribs,  Brisket,  chicken,  turkey, that's a great first step.  Rub is perfect.  But that Mexican corn will make you want to eat until you pop.  Hey the moist brisket,  Mexican corn,  1 link of garlic sausage and a sweet tea. 4 slices of white bread.  You'll wish you lived here."
328,Eugene Cole,Local Guide·34 reviews·171 photos,,2 years ago,"The beef ribs were incredible!  Extremely tender, Smokey and rich in flavor.  The sausage had a great flavor but the texture was granular.  Like it had a grain filler.  The brisket was melt in your mouth, full of beef and smoke flavor."
329,Naveed Rahman,Local Guide·31 reviews,,a year ago,"Really good sausages and the brisket was really tender. They cut the meat right in front of you to give you a better sense of what you're getting, which I really appreciate."
330,Katie,Local Guide·26 reviews·13 photos,,3 years ago,"Amazing BBQ, got a takeout order to our hotel room after a long day and wow! Intense wood fire aroma and top notch dinner. Best BBQ we had on our trip and probably will order again before leaving.

Beef brisket with some fat, Mac and cheese, banana pudding, and pinto beans all delicious."
331,Andrew Smith,Local Guide·79 reviews·109 photos,,a year ago,"Great brisket and ribs, decent sauce, but the bbq doesn’t really need any. I wasn’t too big on the sausage, but overall a good experience and good food."
332,Benjamin “BK” Kenney,Local Guide·199 reviews·559 photos,,2 years ago,"Some of the best BBQ I have had in Texas. The brisket had the best bark ive ever tasted and it was cooked/seasoned perfectly. Everything else was great as well, the brisket was a clear winner"

336,Ginger Cat,11 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"When we first arrived, we waited in line for 30 minutes in the sweltering heat. Once we got inside I noticed that they had communal seating and for 8 people it was hard to find a spot that wasn’t already taken. After a few minutes, we finally were able to get a table. Regarding the menu, they should add more options for side dishes for example, fries or collard greens. When my food arrived I noticed there was only one sauce available. Personally, I prefer to have some sort of sweet BBQ sauce. I ordered the pulled pork and it tasted very good and was very flavorful, but overall not worth the wait or the price."
337,Joshua Narkevicius,Local Guide·29 reviews·45 photos,,3 years ago,"Super short wait time for some classic and delicious BBQ. Chicken, beef ribs, brisket...all great. Sides like Mac and cheese and the Mexican corn were incredible as well. Definitely give the house hot sauces a try if you like some spice"
338,martin flores,7 reviews,,a year ago,"One star but only because of the decor......the food was TERRIBLE, I have never had a meal so bad that I had to walk out and vomit. I’m sorry but I would NEVER recommend this place!!!"
339,R,13 reviews,,a year ago,"The pork ribs are ok. The brisket ( I tried both the lean and fatty one) are salty. The only highlight on the is the pull pork. Blacks bbq is pretty expensive. Best value on the menu is the combo meal. The best bbq and best deal I have had in Texas is at smoke shac in San Antonio, but unfortunately too far"
340,Arun George,Local Guide·73 reviews·7 photos,,3 years ago,"This was our first visit to Austin and since we didn't have time first Franklin and we decided to stay traditional, we zeroed in on Blacks.
We went there just before noon on a Sunday. Parking was a bit of a struggle but we managed to find one spot.
The ambience is really good. The service, just ok. They seemed to be in a hurry. We ordered the brisket, pork ribs and sausage. The brisket still had too much of fat and wasn't warm, which was a slight put off. It was flavorful but I wish the crust has a dash of flavor apart from just smoke.
The ribs were good and so was the jalapeno sausage. We ordered a side of Mexican corn that had the right amount of kick and flavor."
341,David Flores,5 reviews,,2 years ago,Delicious as usual. Love the big giant beef ribs. The Veterans day free meal was amazing.
342,Tom Nauwelaerts,Local Guide·128 reviews·112 photos,,5 years ago,"I have to come back here soon. We were in a hurry to catch a flight and grabbed a quick lunch,  for me consisting of a beef rib and beans. Great hunk of meat, tender and juicy. Maybe a bit too fatty still, like it hadn’t rendered out enough. Beans were good, but I like the more sweet baked bean style better."
343,Andre Goddard,10 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,Brisket was so delicious chicken was super moist but the best items for me where the giant beef rib. Very true to the south bbq pit style vibe and feeling. Family style sit down.

350,Arthur Gutierrez,54 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,OMG!!!  Brisket was fantastic.  Fell apart when you touched it.  Just the right amount of fat and burned outside.  The mac and cheese was a great side to top off our lunch.  Did not disappoint.   The manager was friendly (Go UTSA Baseball!) As was the rest of the staff.
351,Nicholas Crynock,28 reviews·3 photos,,2 years ago,Incredible place!  The food smelled delicious and so did the taste.  Parking was a little difficult but totally worth it
352,cozmickissez,Local Guide·26 reviews·23 photos,,a year ago,"Stopped in yesterday to get a few brisket sandwiches. Food wasnt bad. My complaint is that we got to-go and when we walked back to our car across the street, we checked to see if there were any utensils in the bag. There was not. Walked back over and asked the lady at the front counter for some. She seemed annoyed and said that ""she already gave us some"". Asked for 3 as there were three of us. She only gave 2. This was around 1pm. When we ordered there was only us and one other family in line. She could of just handed us some and not made a remark like that. Which was incorrect anyway. Luckily, we were just visiting Austin for the day. Wont be back to this location."
353,Lonnie Moreno,Local Guide·91 reviews·9 photos,,2 years ago,"Pork spareribs were incredible.  Tender and delish. Loved the marshmallow sweet potato.  BUT, the sausage rings were incredibly dry and and tasted old.  Chicken was completely flavorless and the beans had a rock inside, almost chipped my teeth. You need to pre sort the beans before cooking!  Mixed experience."
354,Ed Doering,2 reviews,,2 years ago,Visited with family from New York April 2019 we told the guy behind the counter we are first time visitors to the restaurant no reaction like that's cool where are you from nothing like that no personality we get better service from New Yorkers and to tell you the truth we have had alot better BBQ in the New York area. The ribs were fatty nothing special by the way I saw the restaurant on the Chew that's why went very disappointed
355,Reza Rahimi,Local Guide·199 reviews·52 photos,,a year ago,One of the best BBQ joints in Austin! They deserve more credit for their ribs by critics.
356,Big Board Gaming,,,3 years ago,Today the brisket was moist and peppery fantastic. The pork rib were dry. They seem to have shrunk up the sausage links too. Great service.
357,Toby Doaks,Local Guide·43 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,"Seriously, the BEST TASTING BBQ EVER!! The staff is always super kind and friendly. Never a bad experience here."
358,V Mai,Local Guide·34 reviews·12 photos,,a year ago,"Very good but not celiac safe.  Sausage has gluten, so cross contamination is highly likely on the grill.  To those without food allergies:  ENJOY!!!!!"
359,Gregory Lyons,Local Guide·57 reviews·8 photos,,3 years ago,"The beef rib was amazing. It literally fell off the bone while I was trying to take a bite from it. The potato salad had eggs in it and was a touch sweeter than most, both good things in my book. The Mac and cheese tasted ""homemade"" without the chalky texture a lot of cafeteria style places have.

Would I drive 150 miles to eat it again?
You bet."
360,Tony L,Local Guide·50 reviews·52 photos,,3 years ago,"Went there for the Beef Rib and was amazed by everything they had to offer. Everything was fantastic from the side to the desserts. I had beef rib, fatty brisket, Mexican corn and pecan cobbler. My only regret was that I may have eaten to much. Seriously enjoyed everything that was on my plate, and left very full and happy. It is a little on the pricey side but man was it worth the price I would go again for the beef rib alone."
361,Chris Lindner,9 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,"The restaurant is following almost none of the social distancing guidelines.  They don't prepare pick up orders ahead of time.  Guests are cramped into a small space to wait in line, and are encouraged by the staff to cram in.  Most customers are not wearing face masks.  They are unconcerned about your health, and are violating local regulations."
362,Rosetta Perry,Local Guide·166 reviews·15 photos,,a year ago,Food was amazing and staff was awesome.  Love the rustic atmosphere.
363,Naqqash Sharif,Local Guide·78 reviews·8 photos,,2 years ago,"Superb brisket, maybe even the best I've had...  Sauce was dead-on and the beef ribs were outrageously awesome."
364,David Davidson,2 reviews,,3 years ago,"BBQ was great! We had a pound of lean brisket, a dino beef rib, regular sausage, jalapeno cheddar sausage, mac n cheese, beans and potato salad. Didn't have to wait long at all. We will definitely be back next time we are in Austin."
365,N Espinoza,Local Guide·24 reviews,,a year ago,Good food. Wish they had different sauces but over all good.
366,Nasir Khan,49 reviews,,3 years ago,"First time in Austin. Brisket was flavorful, moist and tender. Sauce could have been a bit more tangy. It was slightly difficult to find as it is on a side street."
367,James Henderson,"Local Guide·118 reviews·4,703 photos",,11 months ago,Great view of wheatland coop
368,Michael Jackson,Local Guide·147 reviews·15 photos,,2 years ago,"Love the taste of their Bbq... Live close by, so that makes it for an easy round trip bus ride. And, let me tell you... The ride back with my Blacks Bbq on the Bus for 3 stops has me fighting people away from my mouth dripping Q, but the tasty Peach Cobbler too..."
369,Ken Holman,Local Guide·53 reviews·55 photos,,5 months ago,So tasty
370,Mike Anderson,8 reviews,,a year ago,Very friendly and the street corn was awesome. Friendly staff and had the turkey which I would say was one of the tops so.

372,Sherry Costanza,Local Guide·60 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,E ed n tf here for lunch absolutely phenomenal food
373,Amit Chopra,Local Guide·171 reviews·566 photos,,3 years ago,"I am not a big fan of BBQ but joined a few friends who were really Keen to be here. I took a small chicken and side. It was good. Very authentic place, frequented by locals. Simple and good."
374,Harper Jeong,Local Guide·103 reviews·40 photos,,2 years ago,Great food!
375,Meg Recker,5 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,Everything was beyond fantastic. Beef rib was the size of a small child! SO GOOD!
376,Autumn Larbi,5 reviews,,4 years ago,"1st time dining at Black's, never been to Lockhart for that matter. However, Black's is known for its BBQ... It definitely lives up to all it's acclaim. Friendly service walked me through the process of ordering. Wanted to try as much as I could, pork spare ribs, brisket, and garlic link. Ribs tender, brisket tender, and sausage authentic flavor and great texture.  Can't wait for another trip."
377,JohnB 00007,"196 reviews·5,961 photos",,3 years ago,Not bad but not as good as Rudy's Barbecue. Pork rib was ok. Beef brisket was good. Beef rib was excellent. Would like this place better if it were less expensive. We spent about $75.00 for lunch. Some of the meat was $17.99 per pound.
378,Pinaki Ghosh,"Local Guide·555 reviews·1,994 photos",,2 years ago,This is hands down the best bbq place in Austin. Their brisket is better than anything you have ever tried. Once in a while there can be long line. The quality is excellent and the service is great. All people are smiling. The 2 brothers who run the place are my daughter's friend ( she is 7). They run a very very tight ship.
379,Natasha Gutierrez,3 reviews,,6 months ago,The food was AMAZING!!!
380,Joe Arnold,Local Guide·86 reviews·87 photos,,3 years ago,CAn't beat it for traditional Texas Smoked meats!
381,Dee Nieto,14 reviews·4 photos,,a year ago,Bbq was a 5..side's a 1. The Mexican corn was so gross that I had 1 bite and was overpowered with cajun seasoning and lemon....
382,Jovan Cunningham,15 reviews·6 photos,,a year ago,"Not good BBQ at all, the customer service isn't that great either. I would not recommend to anyone especially if you like flavored BBQ. Not to mention it is very expensive and dissatisfying."
383,Michael Yost,Local Guide·62 reviews,,2 years ago,"This is what I think of when I think of southern BBQ. We're from Pennsylvania so when we took a trip to Austin we knew we had to try some of the BBQ and man was it good. Black's was up there from the handful of places we tried and we would definitely go again if we went back down to Austin, just a truly great place."
384,Alicia L,Local Guide·19 reviews,,2 years ago,I definitely make this my last stop EVERY time I visit Austin. I promise you won't be disappointed 😉 I like to try something different every time.
385,Joe Gallahan,Local Guide·23 reviews·2 photos,,4 years ago,Parking is weird: You can't use the lot behind them and the street parking seems to fill up immediately in that area.  There are more places not to park than to park on that whole block.  I asked for lean brisket and got 1/3 of my cut solid un-edible fat.  It was good meat.  Had to ask for the cups for my drink twice. Sides are hot but small.   I
386,Sandra Clark,1 review,,a year ago,"Hands down some of the best BBQ in Texas. If you're looking for moist brisket, look no further!"
387,Jena Naylor,Local Guide·56 reviews·31 photos,,3 years ago,"Get the moist brisket and mac+cheese.  Love this place, so glad I work within walking distance.  I don't see how it missed the TX Top 50.  Better food than Freedman's for sure!"
388,Adam Rivera,3 reviews,,2 years ago,The turkey was so great here. Would love to come back another time
389,Raul Garza,Local Guide·60 reviews·29 photos,,2 years ago,Just like the other Black's BBQ the food was amazing. You can't go wrong with any meat
390,Paul Morales,Local Guide·60 reviews·28 photos,,4 years ago,I have traveled from San Antonio 2 times in the last month just for some Blacks BBQ. Brisket is exceptional. The big a $$ beef ribs are amazing! Smoked Turkey is a tad dry for my liking but overall great BBQ.
391,Tri Tran,"Local Guide·555 reviews·1,630 photos",,4 years ago,This is a good BBQ place.  I think Terry Black is a lot better though.  I actually thought I was going to Terry Black when I ended up here because I didn't realize there were separate Black BBQ in Austin.  Food was still good and there wasn't a line which is good.
392,Nick Durham,Local Guide·65 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"Food was 5 stars, service was 1, averages 3. Would definitely try another location. Ribs and fatty brisket off the heazy."
393,Larry Brehm,4 reviews,,a year ago,First trip to Black's Barbecue..... enjoyed the smoked meat.... tender and delicious
394,Jon Grimm,Local Guide·112 reviews·94 photos,,3 years ago,So this place is excellent. It's close to work for me which makes it very convenient and they do a really brisk trade. The brisket and the turkey are exceptionally good as are most of the sides. You really can't go wrong if you stop off here for barbecue. It definitely gets busy during the lunch hour and there can be a line that reaches outside the building but if you have the time or if you go any time other than lunch you shouldn't have a problem.  There is parking across the street and street parking available and there is indoor and outdoor seating. Highly recommended if you like barbecue.
395,Philip Moore,Local Guide·85 reviews·383 photos,,11 months ago,Lockhart and San Marcos locations are the ones to go to for sure!
396,Chris Davis,Local Guide·226 reviews·168 photos,,a year ago,Best finger lickin darn BBQ I have ever tasted! These guys win! I now to perfection! I WANT MORE NOW!
397,Mike Mercier,Local Guide·60 reviews·20 photos,,3 years ago,Those were the best ribs ive ever had. The best part is that its been an hour and i still smell like smoke. Which smells awesome. HIGHLY recommended the beef brisket is 🔥🔥🔥too. The best
398,Liz Pool,Local Guide·148 reviews·89 photos,,2 years ago,"This was the only Blacks establishment we had yet to visit. It stacks up to the others. My favorite brisket on the planet so far. If I find any better, I'll eat it!"
399,Marisa Alonzo,Local Guide·28 reviews·26 photos,,5 years ago,"Great BBQ! Brisket and turkey was flavorful and delicious, however, the brisket was cut from the end and contained a bit of fat. Mexican street corn had a great spice. Mac and cheese was yummy and cheesy. The cashier tossed in a complimentary potato salad! Would eat here again."
400,Isabella Ramos,8 reviews·4 photos,,a year ago,Great bbq always packed a must try also their bbq sauces they make themselves is Amazing !
401,Connor McLaughlin,Local Guide·49 reviews·1 photo,,3 years ago,I had their fat brisket & my god was blown away. food was amazing and service was even better. on the pricier side but 100000% worth it
402,Ric Zendrosky,Local Guide·89 reviews·179 photos,,2 years ago,If not the best brisket one of the best. I also enjoyed their sausage and chicken. Their sides are also all good.
403,Jeff Liu,Local Guide·129 reviews·54 photos,,2 years ago,Foods good. Brisk is not dry. Service is straightforward and sharp.
404,Robert Fleming,2 reviews,,7 months ago,Awesome food!
405,Nathan Petersen,Local Guide·53 reviews·87 photos,,3 years ago,"Great place! I like how the building is older and the place seems like a bit of a hole in the wall. The brisket is very good, as well as the hot links."
406,Paul Van Allen,22 reviews,,4 years ago,We had my father in law's 70th birthday here and the people at Blacks could not have been nicer and more accommodating.  It was a last minute move and they were great about an outside cake and even gave my wife's father a free hat or T-shirt of his choice.  The brisket was good (not amazing) but the turkey was shockingly good...best turkey I've ever had at a BBQ place.
407,Bobby Dewrell,Local Guide·87 reviews·44 photos,,3 years ago,"Oh my goodness.... some of the best bbq I have ever had.  Little expensive, but so worth it.  I had a little pork, little brisket, some mac-n-cheese and green beans... so full after and so in love... I will be back"
408,Pavel Válek,Local Guide·20 reviews·168 photos,,4 years ago,Best BBQ
409,Richard Smith,5 reviews,,4 years ago,Excellent food and service. Prices are reasonable for Austin BBQ. Both indoor and outdoor seating. Have been there several times - it's only a mile from our house and same good food and service each visit.
410,Stephen Chambers,"Local Guide·68 reviews·2,556 photos",,a year ago,One of if not the best barbecue I've ever had. Everything I tried was absolutely perfect.
411,Amanda Abel-Shepherd,Local Guide·51 reviews·4 photos,,3 years ago,It was ok. Nothing real unique to it. Would have been higher stars if they had an easier way of ordering like offering plates with 1 meat or 2 and a family pack price.
412,Jérôme Poulin,Local Guide·62 reviews·140 photos,,a year ago,Great smoky flavor and smell when you enter. Nice ambiance!
413,Dawn Burton,Local Guide·19 reviews·26 photos,,2 years ago,"Really juicy meat, tantalizing taste. So good. Little sausage rings, so order more than one if you were thinking it was a big link"
414,maddmaxjack67,Local Guide·43 reviews·4 photos,,2 years ago,"Small location, can be hard to find a seat when busy. The food is excellent, haven’t been disappointed eating there ever! Sometimes the staff can be a little less than professional and short with customers, but the overall experience is what you would expect for a busy bbq joint. FYI, the sausage links are rather small so order more than one! Pro tip: order everything you want when you get to the register, because you may not get another chance due to long lines!"
415,Sarah Carmical,Local Guide·19 reviews·2 photos,,3 years ago,Oh. My. Goodness. The fatty brisket and the mac n' cheese are some of the best I've ever had. Beef rib was stellar. Skip the banana pudding for dessert and go for the cobbler.
416,Paul Mathis,Local Guide·24 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,One of the best bbq joints in Texas. The jalapeno links are amazing
417,Ryan Widmier,Local Guide·310 reviews,,6 years ago,"High quality meats and sides. Pretty good sauce. Fast service. Nice place. It checks a lot of boxes for me, and it's just around the block."
418,Sharon Sims,32 reviews,,2 years ago,"Had delicious beef brisket. A large part of 300 people had come in earlier cleaned them out of beef ribs, pork ribs and chicken!😭  On our next visit to Austin we will try again!"
419,Joan Gillcrist,Local Guide·69 reviews,,3 years ago,Not expensive for what they give you. Not sure how they do it. Comfortable place. Low key. Solid.
420,Kangwook Kim,Local Guide·55 reviews·7 photos,,3 years ago,Best brisket.
421,Keisha Branch,Local Guide·18 reviews,,3 years ago,Wonderful staff and wonderful food!!! Definitely an Austin staple I will be revisiting! And they give pretty hefty portions!
422,Sean Collins,Local Guide·131 reviews·3 photos,,3 years ago,"I needed to be rolled out of the place.
Great smoke and seasoning and the meat just fell of the bone for the beef ribs. Brisket is great too and loved the sausage. Solid sides too. I wasn't expecting much of the sides, but they were good."
423,Mikki Nino,Local Guide·48 reviews·45 photos,,a year ago,Fall off the bone ribs and brisket that melts in your mouth definitely a go to for BBQ!
424,James Oliver,Local Guide·49 reviews·918 photos,,6 years ago,"Two words 'Beef Rib'. It was just amazing and the meat fell off the bone. Also, the mac n cheese was quite nice considering what you get from most BBQ joints. The location is great, parking was not bad at all and the best part of all no wait, yet you're getting some of the best and most historic BBQ in Texas.

""Take me Back to Black's"""
425,Sam E,9 reviews,,4 years ago,"Out of townees chose based on reviews.  Line was long to get in and not a lot of seating.  Food was just okay. Mac and Cheese was great. Brisket was better than most. Sausage, chicken, potato salad, and green beans just ok. Pretty great sauce flavors. Would go again just no wow factor."
426,Jose Humberto Flores,1 review·1 photo,,3 years ago,Nice place to eat
427,Jingyao Huang,12 reviews,,3 years ago,"Great BBO! The pork ribs and beef ribs are so good! Except the long waiting time, I would give five stars"
428,Mahesh Paolini-Subramanya,"Local Guide·518 reviews·3,135 photos",,4 years ago,"The Austin outpost of a Lockhart institution - the place doesn't disappoint.  The brisket is stellar (the fatty stuff is brilliant, and the lean stuff is equally but differently good), the beef ribs are *outstanding*, and the sauce is addictive.
The coleslaw and pickles are highly acidic, which - significantly - helps cut the fat.
All in all, well worth the line you end up standing in.
Note - the line is basically you waiting to get served - once you do, there is usually plenty of space to sit...

(Mind you, the pork-ribs suffer in comparison, but only in comparison, and the turkey is best stayed away from.)"
429,Ben Zimmerman,"Local Guide·251 reviews·1,844 photos",,3 years ago,"This place has amazing BBQ beef ribs. Absolutely recommend, with the caveat that it is best to arrive at lunch than at dinner to be able to enjoy the ribs before they sell out. Three is too many, one a huge amount. Do not miss the Mac and cheese too, as it is especially peppery and very cheesey."
430,James Deaville,24 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,Wonderful brisket but go for the fat version: the lean brisket can be dry. The sides are excellent as well.
431,Julie Anne Monroe,Local Guide·67 reviews·416 photos,,2 years ago,"Blacks BBQ is always on point!! It's definitely a favorite when we visit Austin!! You cant go wrong with the Brisket, and I highly recommend their jalapeno cheese sausage!!"
432,Gerry Laplante,Local Guide·74 reviews·182 photos,,2 years ago,"The place smells great! The BBQ sandwich I ordered was awesome.  They sell food by the pound.  Great sides, too."
433,Milous Mitchell III,8 reviews·17 photos,,2 years ago,"Horrible service, I had never been there before was visiting on a work trip. I walked in and wasn't really welcomed, then when I ordered they were kinda just like whatever about it and then added stuff I didn't even ask for to my plate and didn't offer to exchange the item. I had to ask. Overall food quality was plain and dry I would rate this place a step above dickies bbq. Sad that people can ruin a nice establishment with history. But it happens."
434,Amanda Medina,2 reviews,,2 years ago,I called to see what they served and the guy on the phone didn’t understand my question. I dont know what was so difficult. All i asked was “what kinds of meat do you guys have” and he said he didn’t understand. Then he understood after I explained myself and then he says “and were kinda out of everything for the night” and i called 2 hours before they closed. How do you run out of everything when you still have 2 hours left.
435,Arren “A.C.”,Local Guide·149 reviews·54 photos,,10 months ago,"Customer service here has never been that great but it has DEFINITELY declined since my last review. On top of that, when I came in there The Cutter had all types of attitude and was hacksawing at the brisket; which I knew in that moment meant one of two things: his knife wasn't sharp or that brisket was dry -- sure enough the brisket was insanely dry.

Update: 02/11/21: The ""response from the owner"" is purely theatrics. I emailed as they requested and never heard a word from them... That was 30 days ago today."
436,David Johns,Local Guide·284 reviews·380 photos,,2 years ago,My family's favorite BBQ place in the Austin area. We've tried several and this one had the best brisket and I LOVE their sweet potatoes. Highly recommended!
437,Richard Kennedy,Local Guide·27 reviews·6 photos,,a year ago,Great BBQ without a 3-hour wait.
438,Terrence Adams,"Local Guide·248 reviews·1,313 photos",,4 years ago,"One of a kind. My rental car agent recommended it. He told me he was from Austin, and never ate at Franklin's because he wouldn't wait in line. So he sent me here instead. I had to smuggle a brisket sandwich back on the plane...the peach cobbler didn't even make it that far. Just go...you won't be sorry."
439,Virgilio Altamirano,Local Guide·37 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,Brontosaurus sized beef ribs melting off the bone...only for the BEST.
440,Vance Ely,"Local Guide·789 reviews·3,225 photos",,3 years ago,So excited to have Black BBQ in Austin. I still drive out to the original every so often but nice to be able to get my BBQ fix on a simi weekly basis now. Great team of people working in this location. Amazing BBQ.
441,S French,Local Guide·94 reviews·9 photos,,a year ago,"Ok I loved the location in Lockhart. And I have to say, my sandwich was fantastic."
442,Alexandra Woodford,Local Guide·32 reviews,,3 years ago,Good BBQ but not as good as Coopers in our opinion. The beef ribs were very tender but almost to the point of tasting greasy/fatty. The beans were okay. The sweet potato was excellent.
443,Raymond Watkins,Local Guide·124 reviews·14 photos,,a year ago,"Great food, prices, service and atmosphere."
444,Buck Wallander,Local Guide·63 reviews·129 photos,,4 years ago,"Anytime I have company visiting who don't have a day to kill ""standing in line"" for great barbecue, I point them directly to Black's on Guadalupe...just as great without the wait. As a regular smoked meat elitist Austinite, this is my personal Go-To BBQ. Need a great recommendation? Order a hand-made cheddar sausage link to go with your quarter lb of moist brisket and/or beef rib. Skip the sides."
445,Kylee Ryckman,Local Guide·175 reviews·190 photos,,3 years ago,These guys have amazing food and do amazing catering! They treated me like family through the whole process! (I HIGHLY recommend the pecan pie!)

449,J Estrada,2 reviews,,3 years ago,"I heard great things about this place. The line was out the door and around the corner. I was thinking to myself, “This must be really good food.” I was sorely disappointed. Half of my brisket was charred to the point of not being edible, the other half was extremely dry and salty. I’d give it a zero if possible."
450,Drkone Davis,7 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,Loved the food loved the friendly service. and it was the first time being invited to the place by a friend. You will get your money's worth
451,Matt McMonagle,Local Guide·33 reviews·15 photos,,a year ago,This BBQ joint is so underrated. I love the brisket and sausage and there's hardly ever a line! I've probably been 10 times and each time the quality was consistent and delicious. I'd say it's in my top 3 favorite bbq joints in austin along with LA BBQ and Mickelthwaits.
452,Billy Shelton,Local Guide·11 reviews·35 photos,,9 months ago,Best BBQ hands down!!!
453,Sal Catalfamo,Local Guide·30 reviews·10 photos,,5 years ago,"Great BBQ!  Was in Austin for a conference and wanted real Texas BBQ, and Black's did not disappoint.  Simple, flavorful meats that required no sauce at all.  My favorite was the brisket (fatty style).  I'll definitely be back!"

457,Lui Sieh,Local Guide·150 reviews·148 photos,,3 years ago,Amazing fatty beef brisket that was so soft and juicy. A very nice comfy place and quick helpful service. Must visit in Austin.
458,Jason Edmondson,Local Guide·26 reviews·2 photos,,2 years ago,I have eaten at this location a few times and I have enjoyed each time. Texas has many bbq staples. If your on that side of town don't get fast food make it a bbq treat.
459,Mark Balderman-Highlove,Local Guide·19 reviews·9 photos,,3 years ago,Holy cow this place is good!  You don't even need teeth to enjoy the brisket because it melts in your mouth.  Real Texas BBQ.  I love it.
460,Wanda Golden,13 reviews,,4 years ago,Absolutely wonderful....the fatty brisket and spare ribs were very tasty and tender. I almost did not need to chew it was so tender. Will definitely come back again on my next visit to Austin.

465,A Google User,1 review,,2 years ago,Excellent string beans and good potato salad. Dry brisket sliced too thick to chew with a predominant flavor of brine.
466,rudresh ghosh,Local Guide·92 reviews·554 photos,,4 years ago,"I always get the beef rib. You walk around Austin, you will get enough number of really good brisket places ( and the brisket at Black's is amazing), but a really good beef rib is another story. It's fall off the bone, tender, moist goodness. I love it."
467,Karissa DuBose,Local Guide·20 reviews·61 photos,,a year ago,The food was amazing atmosphere is great great place to take people who are visiting
468,Carlos Watts,4 reviews,,3 years ago,bbq and service at this location is super good. Definitely one of the best places in the area. I've had nothing but enjoyable experiences here and plan to keep visiting.

471,Klaire 's email,Local Guide·11 reviews,,3 years ago,"Best Beef Rib I've ever had. Brisket was pretty spectacular as well. I was looking forward to the jalapeño sausage, but it had an overwhelming cornmeal flavor I didn't quite enjoy. Hands down, I'd come here again before Franklin's or Terry Black's."
472,Robert Cameron,Local Guide·42 reviews·6 photos,,3 years ago,"We set up a time to meet with Leslie about catering our wedding.  We received several very brief e-mails in response to our questions about the possibly of having them cater.  They knew we were having the wedding in Austin and that we both live in Austin.  We show up at this location to meet Leslie at the agreed time of 12:30 with a list of prepared questions about how the catering will work.  We get there and are met with a look of confused faces when we say we're there to speak with Leslie about catering.  One of the servers at the front goes to the back, comes back a few minutes later and says, ""She's on her way"".  Another 15 minutes goes by, we ask if she's almost here and he calls her.  This server says, ""She's in Lockhart"".  I said, ""That doesn't make any sense, why would we drive an hour out of town just to taste their food in the middle of the work day in Lockhart?"" He then says a few things to her and comes back and says that she said that she will let him give us a few tastings there.  This was ridiculous to us because we obviously intended to sit down and thoroughly discuss the possibility of catering given its importance to the success of a wedding and the thousands of dollars involved in paying for it.  We told him ""No thanks"" and left.  Just consider this if you're considering having them cater for you."

474,Christopher D Prevel,Local Guide·64 reviews,,2 years ago,Tender and tasty brisket as well as pulled pork. Very friendly staff and prompt service. What a difference from Franklins.
475,Bot Dingo,"Local Guide·476 reviews·2,208 photos",,a year ago,The best out there. Gotta try their Pecan pudding
476,Kristine Nelson,Local Guide·16 reviews·10 photos,,5 years ago,The BBQ is excellent. The sausage links are the best. They are homemade which makes the texture of them great. The brisket is excellent also. The mac and cheese is delicious too. Whenever I'm in Austin or Lockhart it's a stop I always make.
477,J Potts,5 reviews,,a year ago,Barbeque great!! Dessert was a reach.
478,Tracy Houston (Nimi Asante),Local Guide·240 reviews·79 photos,,2 years ago,"Great brisket. The Mac and cheese is really good too. A bit expensive and customer service could be better, but overall...very good bbq."
479,Mariano Figueroa,64 reviews,,2 years ago,Juicy brisket. Place is busy but they have outdoor seating to handle the extra customers.
480,stan tincher,Local Guide·99 reviews,,2 years ago,"Convenient location near north campus of UT, providing the great taste of BLACK'S BBQ. Making a BBQ lunch possible during a short lunch period."
481,Joel Mosier,Local Guide·559 reviews,,3 years ago,This is my favorite bbq in the area. Sliced or brisket. The ribs just melt in your mouth. The staff is friendly. The sides are well cooked and tasty. Try the cobbler if you have room after the meal.
482,Kevin Smith,Local Guide·140 reviews·282 photos,,a year ago,"Super friendly staff, gave great advice and amazing BBQ!"
483,L Radar,19 reviews,,2 years ago,Best bbq I've ever had! I stopped on my way from FL to CO! So good! SOOOOO good. I can't even express how good! Smiled from ear to ear and even ate leftovers as I cruised through Texas during the wee hours of the next morning. Thank you!
484,Max Hietpas,Local Guide·148 reviews·311 photos,,5 years ago,"This place gets a lot of hype, but I'm not sure why.  Sure the bbq is good, but the sauce and sides could use some love, because I think corners are cut and artificial ingredients are added.  I haven't had the deserts but damn did they look tasty."
485,Zach M,Local Guide·26 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,"Loved it, could use cornbread though"
486,Yasenia vasquez,10 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,"Food was amazing and the customer service was really good, Juan was very helpful and knowledgeable about the restaurant. He made me feel like I was at home."
487,Ronald Chaires,21 reviews,,2 years ago,Originally out of Lockhart Texas. Still original flavor. This is BBQ served by the pound No fancy sides. Just good old fashioned beef Texas style. Come with a Texas sized appetite.
488,Mike Thornton,Local Guide·111 reviews·122 photos,,2 years ago,Excellent!  Great everything.  The best Sausage I have had.
489,Derek Chamorro,"Local Guide·250 reviews·2,050 photos",,5 years ago,"One of the original Central Texas BBQ places. While the original still lives in Lockhart, TX, we've been blessed in having a location open up near UT campus. The flavor is consistent across both locations, with GIANT beef ribs being one of the favorites. Save room for dessert, as BBQ isn't complete without a nice portion of banana pudding!"
490,Melvin Sanchez,Local Guide·70 reviews·69 photos,,2 years ago,Delicious barbeque. Pricey but tasty. You won't be disappointed.
491,Robbie M,Local Guide·46 reviews·14 photos,,2 years ago,"My buddy and first went to Blacks years ago in Lockhart. It used to be a really dingy place with dust caked on the ceiling fans. It’s now rightfully grown into its many location including this one I went to. Everything they do here they do well, but my personally favorite is the brisket. The rub they use is caked on with a salty crustiness that really complements a lean cut."
492,Vince Stermer,Local Guide·61 reviews·1 photo,,a year ago,"My long time favorite, awesome pork and beef ribs both, the brisket is the best i have had, the bark/rub is perfect! Check it or miss out!👌"
493,Vincent Nemeth,4 reviews,,2 years ago,Whatever they use for the brisket rub was salty as hell. I left chugging six cups of water it was so salty. I love the bark of the brisket but it's bad when you have to cut it off to enjoy. My family highly recommended the place boy was I disappointed. Also the meat was dry I fixed it a little by soaking it bbque sauce...lol
494,dnvrsdad1,19 reviews·7 photos,,2 years ago,Never knew this location existed! Food was as good as the Barton Creek location. Will be back!
495,Zakary Keith,Local Guide·196 reviews·131 photos,,2 years ago,"First and foremost, Austin Bbq is represented well here! Frankie who? The bad. My wife's credit card was compromised after making a purchase here. I will be back no doubt but cash only from now on."
496,Pamela Whitney,Local Guide·204 reviews·108 photos,,2 years ago,Sub par bbq. I love brisket and ribs and this was more expensive than most ive had and the taste was at the bottom of all my experiences.  No wonder there was no line!
497,Rodney Poche,Local Guide·18 reviews·35 photos,,a year ago,"The BBQ and sides were very good, albeit a little on the pricy side."
498,Dawn Iverson,3 reviews,,a year ago,Their brisket melts in your mouth. Go before 2pm to make sure you get served!
499,Ajit & Anita Singh,2 reviews,,a year ago,Coming out of quarantine..the pulled pork was completely worth it.. 😀
500,Joel Benoit,Local Guide·21 reviews·1 photo,,4 years ago,"Awesome food and culture! Their meat is amazing and would go back in a heartbeat, if I wasn't a poor college student that is.  Good bbq at affordable prices."
501,Tyler Montgomery,Local Guide·14 reviews·22 photos,,4 years ago,Ain't Texas without some BBQ
502,Marian Sasso,Local Guide·72 reviews·10 photos,,4 years ago,The BBQ here is absolutely delicious. I had the brisket and it was cooked perfectly. I would be a regular if I lived in Austin. I might go back just to eat here! The green beans are so tasty!
503,Melissa Patrick,Local Guide·77 reviews·6 photos,,2 years ago,"I love the original in Lockhart...and this place is incredible as well!!! Sampled the brisket, pork ribs, sausage, and beef rib....so glad we have leftovers!!! Make sure to try the street corn and pecan cobbler too!!!"
504,Otis Baer,Local Guide·177 reviews·18 photos,,a year ago,"Good food, nicly priced. Beef bisqit is the one."
505,John Hatfield,93 reviews,,a year ago,"I don't care what people think about Franklin's, Blacks BBQ is the best. We been to the store in Austin,  San Marcos and Lockhart...it's consistantly great!"
506,Joe Bryson,Local Guide·82 reviews·176 photos,,2 years ago,"Great BBQ. A liitle pricey, but some of the best."
507,Luke Mike,Local Guide·207 reviews·70 photos,,2 years ago,So gooood! Great reviews lead us to this place and its history. Lived up too all the great things. Yumm still in a food comatose  : )
508,Janie Monique,5 reviews·3 photos,,4 years ago,"Customer service is horrid! I placed an order over the phone. The guy Gabriel smacked his teeth and asked “what do you want?” And was clearly agitated the whole time as if it were a problem to do his job. When I arrived on site. The food was just in a bag on the counter, there was not an attempt to keep it warm. Horrible location"
509,Lindsey Van Roy (Hello Beautiful Boudoir!),4 reviews·2 photos,,2 years ago,This BBQ tastes like it was marinated in a bowl of LIQUID SMOKE before they cooked it. Yuck. We had such great expectations of their food and it was really disappointing. I'm sure it is all about personal preference but this just didn't cut it for me. I've never liked chewing on smoke...waaaay over smoked.
510,Chrissy Qualman,Local Guide·42 reviews·79 photos,,3 years ago,Our Uber driver recommended this place and we were NOT disappointed. Order larger sides and share if you go with a friend. The sausage rings are to die for. Everything we tried was amazing.
511,Patrick Brown,Local Guide·60 reviews·22 photos,,2 years ago,"Beef brisket and beef rib were exceptional,  the potato salad made it an almost perfect meal."
512,Jos Selig,Local Guide·104 reviews·48 photos,,3 years ago,"It was the only BBQ joint open on Monday. Drove up from San Antonio.  Good food, good atmosphere. Have not eaten at original,  but I enjoyed this place."
513,Tara White,Local Guide·220 reviews·359 photos,,4 years ago,Some of the best barbecue I've ever had. Every bit as good as what you can get at the original store in Lockhart. They really are the best in Texas.
514,Mikel Berry,Local Guide·42 reviews·66 photos,,3 years ago,"The Original Black's BBQ in Lockhart Texas set the bar very high, for anyone else.  Terry Black's came really close. This new, second location for the Original family really missed the mark. It doesn't have any of the flavors that made Blacks famous. It's still better than Smokey Moe's. But for the best BBQ in Texas, you still have to go to Lockhart."
515,greavediggermanhunter Alterego,Local Guide·44 reviews·21 photos,,a year ago,Awesome atmosphere - great BBQ HISTORY & TASTE!!!
516,Kennisha Sanford,3 reviews,,4 years ago,I order 3lbs. of brisket and 3lb. of pork ribs for my team at work. Everyone said it was finger licking good. And they didn't know about your business and will definitely stop by again.
517,Nathan Pabich,Local Guide·329 reviews·88 photos,,3 years ago,Really good brisket here. The mac is worth a try too. The house made hot sauces are worth a spin.
518,Elizabeth Ford,Local Guide·105 reviews·39 photos,,4 years ago,"I was so glad we chose this restaurant for our BBQ experience!  Good food, Decent prices, and NO LINE!  We had multiple Uber drivers recommend it and they were correct!"
519,Matthew Foster,1 review,,7 years ago,"One of my top BBQ experiences in Texas and I have had quite a few..

Extremely friendly staff and fantastic food. The brisket was extremely tender and their sauce is very tasty. The pecan and peach cobbler were amazing too, even when I thought I was too full to eat anything else. Black's will definitely be one of my regular places now.

I have lived in the area for a long time and never knew about this BBQ joint having opened an Austin location so close to me. It's on the corner of Guad and 31st 1/2 street so can be easy to miss if you aren't looking. I had driven by probably several hundred times before finding it after I searched online. So glad I found this place!"
520,Daphne Staton,Local Guide·127 reviews·38 photos,,4 years ago,"Had a turkey sandwich, and peach cobbler was amazing. My husband was very pleased with both his brisket and ribs. Sauce was nothing to scream about. Overall good value."
521,Belia Torres,Local Guide·29 reviews·2 photos,,3 years ago,"Definitely recommend the brisket! The food is great and the staff is nice.

Only gave it a 4 Star due to the location. Parking is a pain and it’s a relatively small restaurant but if you’ve got the patience for it, it’s worth it!"
522,Nick Barker,12 reviews·1 photo,,4 years ago,Probably the best brisket in town. Haven't been to Franklins but you won't have to wait here. Mac n' Cheese is almost as good as the meat!
523,Andrea McGee,10 reviews·1 photo,,2 years ago,Best beef brisket ever. I got the fatty one. My son is very picky and he loved the pulled pork.
524,Honest Abe,Local Guide·77 reviews·51 photos,,2 years ago,"i have to say the brisket was super tender and very well smoked. the guy cutting it could use a little lesson in customer service, but the food makes up for the little boy power trip attitude."
525,Rebecca Kovacs,Local Guide·13 reviews·3 photos,,2 years ago,"Terrible customer service from Sean, specifically. I asked if they would smoke a turkey for me and he berated me over the phone. He could have just explained to me why they won't do it, but instead he belittled me. I've never received such an attitude before. I am shocked at the lack of professionalism and customer service from Black's."
526,Reesie 122,18 reviews·14 photos,,4 years ago,The meat was great and tasty. Very tender. I'm from Michigan and I will definitely return to eat at BLACK'S BBQ again. AWESOME
527,Matthew West,Local Guide·55 reviews·17 photos,,2 years ago,Overall great stuff. The giant beef ribs and mac & cheese were really good. The baked beans were a little underwhelming.
528,Ken Mitschke,Local Guide·73 reviews·12 photos,,2 years ago,Brisket and turkey were smokey and tender. The sausage was neither dry nor too fatty. It was very flavorful. Parking was a little challenging.
529,Mike Chartrand,Local Guide·29 reviews·26 photos,,4 years ago,Food is really good. Like really good. Price was on point too. Selection suffered a little and that is why only 4 stars. Friendly staff and very clean.
530,Travis L McIntire,"Local Guide·465 reviews·9,791 photos",,4 years ago,"BBQ is very good. Ordered and weighed by the pound. Sides by the pint, quart, etc. Eat family style and enjoy. Get a little of everything! 😉"
531,Bill Moore,Local Guide·17 reviews·15 photos,,2 years ago,I owned 3 restaurants in Mississippi ( one was BBQ ) ...in Texas I always ordered bbq Pork ribs to be safe for I thought I did not like beef ribs....I LOVE Blacks beef ribs !!!  Last week I ordered pork ribs here and LOVED them ....today I also am taking home a dozen tamales oboy oboy oboy !!!!
532,Sharen Lloyd,74 reviews,,2 years ago,Delicious!! Friendly service! Casual atmosphere! Highly recommend!!
533,Ashley Ward,Local Guide·74 reviews·30 photos,,5 years ago,"The place was nice and the meat was really good! Sides weren't as great as some I've had other places. So, really good brisket, not really good sides."
534,Sarah G,6 reviews·6 photos,,2 years ago,Holy hell. I've never been a fan of barbacue. That is until I visted this place! A must place to eat in Austin. No need to waste money at fancy place.
535,cali sando,Local Guide·119 reviews·18 photos,,3 years ago,Never enjoyed the meat sweats so much in my life.   Awesome food.   Beef ribs are amazing!
536,Lance,40 reviews·2 photos,,2 years ago,"Crowded, long wait for decent texas bbq.

On the plus side, great to see the owner care enough to track feedback. :)"
537,David Blair Kennedy,Local Guide·177 reviews·58 photos,,3 years ago,This BBQ is great.  Brisket is nice and juicy.  Beef Ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  We’ll be back.
538,Valerie Paine,Local Guide·66 reviews·478 photos,,a year ago,Oh my gosh! Yum yum yum! The moist brisket is AMAZING!
539,Jennie Torres,Local Guide·29 reviews,,3 years ago,Awesome place for a quick bite. Barbecue you can always rely on to be good. Atmosphere is nice in a great Austin neighborhood.
540,Kelvin Wong,22 reviews·2 photos,,a year ago,Terry blacks has much better brisket. Just pass on the pork ribs here....it’s not bad but very bland/disappointing
541,Danny Cox,Local Guide·42 reviews·116 photos,,4 years ago,Just as good as the original. I talked to the owner in Lockhart and he said all their meat comes from the same pit for both locations. They drive the meat in fresh daily. Austin wouldn't let them build the pits the way they wanted to and they weren't going to compromise. Some of the best BBQ around. You can't go wrong with the brisket or porkchop.
542,Steve Freeman,44 reviews·48 photos,,5 years ago,Excellent beef rib!! Great service. Will definitely return the next time I'm in Austin.
543,"James Wesley, Senior",Local Guide·87 reviews·106 photos,,2 years ago,I now have a tie for best texas bbq! Love the brisket and sausage.
544,Juan Cardenas,Local Guide·124 reviews·138 photos,,2 years ago,Best barbecue I've ever had. We got there late so hey ran out of most of what we wanted but still loved what we had.
545,David Morris,7 reviews,,2 years ago,The ribs are amazing!  This is an Austin institution that everyone should try
546,Alejandra Perez,Local Guide·27 reviews·4 photos,,2 years ago,Delicious brisket! Melts in your mouth. I swear it’s cooked perfectly every time.
547,Lonzell Locklear,1 review,,2 years ago,"Tasty brisket,delish mac n’ cheese, great Green Beans! Perfect meal was washed down with a nice ZiegenBock!"
548,Billy T,Local Guide·84 reviews·9 photos,,a year ago,Food was fine but I'd go look elsewhere
549,Becky Neas,5 reviews,,2 years ago,"The staff was unfriendly and rude. The food wasn’t bad, but the brisket was really dry. The BBQ sauce was watery and vinegar based. Mac n cheese was good, but the beans were flavorless. Wouldn’t recommend if you love bbq."
550,Laura Payne Breeland,12 reviews,,2 years ago,"Delicious, short wait but they move the line quickly."
551,Thomas Foster,2 reviews,,2 years ago,"The very best barbeque I had in awhile. We sampled everything except the sausages, next time we will try them. Yummmmy!"
552,Auran B,Local Guide·51 reviews·47 photos,,4 years ago,This place had delicious food and pleasant decor. The fatty beef brisket was juicy and tender. The staff were very friendly as well.
553,Tony Bush,Local Guide·160 reviews·57 photos,,2 years ago,"Amazing brisket, amazing sides, great service"
554,Pa ca,13 reviews,,a year ago,Expensive like a m.o.f.u  31 dollars 4 one beef  rib 2 sides and a small brisket sandwich !! Lord have mercy..dried mac & cheese ..potatos sadad terrible !!!
555,Christine Smith,Local Guide·255 reviews·3 photos,,2 years ago,"Got the double meat pulled pork sandwich and it was soooo good. So basically they give it to you plain and then you have the option of adding pickles, onions, jalapeños, and bbq sauce. The options are open for you to grab in like a self serve bar. Sides we got: coleslaw (ok), Mac and cheese (sooo good), sweet potatoes (so good), potato salad (good), peach cobbler (good), and lastly banana pudding (good). We went on a Saturday and arrived around 5ish and there were like 4 people ahead of us but essentially not a long wait and we were able to get a table. Total cost for all those sides and 3 double meat pulled pork sandwiches and 3 drinks was about $70 (includes tip). We would definitely recommend and come back."
556,joshua retief,Local Guide·36 reviews·9 photos,,2 years ago,"Ill be honest I have no idea how this place has more than 4 stars. It's one of the most lackluster BBQ experiences I've had in Austin. I keep seeing this place on top Austin BBQ lists and am extremely disappointed. With the likes of Franklins, Salt Lick, even Rudys and La Barbeque on your doorstep, why would you crave this overpriced, underdelivering spot? The meat has no flavor, the sauce tastes watered down, the best thing I've eaten here are the pickles. I apologize for nothing, try every other spot in Austin before you end up here for the sake of your palette."
557,Stuart Rennie,Local Guide·198 reviews·43 photos,,3 years ago,"Average at best.  Meat was cooked...end of story. Ribs (seem boiled) had  almost no flavor. Brisket was ok, however fatty has a ton of fat on it. Look at my picture...the ribs are as dry as Blacks customer service. Service is average at best. Doesn’t compare to Cooper or Franklin BBQ at all. Truly disappointed."
558,Julie Tietje,16 reviews·40 photos,,2 years ago,"Great pork ribs, sausage, green beans, & peach cobbler. Great Sunday lunch location eating on the patio."
559,Elton Lewis,2 reviews·1 photo,,4 years ago,"Always a good choice. Mac and cheese was a little bit off today. Everything else was awesome as usual.

4 of 5 stars"
